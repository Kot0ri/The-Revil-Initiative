 UC0075_NAME:0 "Gihren's Greed"
 UC0075_DESC:0 "U.C.0075 - It had already been half a century since humanity began to immigrate its overgrown population into space. The huge man-made colonies around the earth became the second home of humanity, with a new generation of 'Spacenoids' living within their walls. In Colony Group Side 3 on the far side of the moon, the Zabi family had taken power after the death of Zeon Zum Deikun. The Zabi family changed course from Deikun's goal of independence through dialogue with the Earth Federation to one of natonalistic zeal and won popular support, establisheding a Zabi dictatorship. The Earth Federation government passes economic sanctions against the Zabi family's dictatorship, but was unable to do anything further for fear of the other colonies following suit.  Now Earth and Space are at a tipping point."
 ZEO_UC0075_DESC:0 "The idea of Zeonism, once advocated by Zeon Zum Deikun, has now spread throughout the Earth's sphere and Side 3 is becoming the holy land of Zeonism. On the domestic front the Zabi family's rule is becoming more firmly established, but some former Deikun politicians, the media and academics, are questioning the Zabi family's policies.\nWhether to continue to resist the Earth Federation with Side 3 alone, or to join forces with all the Spacenoids as the standard bearers of Zeonism, General Gihren Zabi is at a crossroads."
 EFS_UC0075_DESC:0 "Out of a population of over 11 billion in U.C. 0050, 9 billion people are already living in space, meaning the grand space immigration program that began in the first year of the Universal Century had reached its goal. While the relocation of government functions to space is not even in sight since the tragic accident on Laplace, the data showing the recovery of the Earth's environment is becoming more and more credible each year.  However, this progress and the Federation itself is now being challenegd by the rise of Zeonism across Space leading to a tension not seen since the old AD era"
 OTHER_UC0075_DESC:0 "The space immigration policy was an abstention policy. This is becoming a fact that the spacenoids, half of whom are now second-generation immigrants, do not want to admit. The federal government has vowed to complete the immigration project with the completion of Side 7, which is under construction, and the completion of immigration, but problems remain piling up including the maintenance of an aging colony and the ever-growing population and widening disparities. Each Side and the lunar cities are trying to keep each other in check while secretly keeping an eye on each other."

 UC0078_NAME:0 "Operation British"
 UC0078_DESC:0 "U.C. 0078 - The political break between the Earth Federation Government and the Side 3 Zeon Autonomous Republic was finally about to reach a tipping point. The appeasement policy of the Earth Federation government, which tries to correct the situation by indirect checks and balances such as economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure, has been completely betrayed by the birth of the Pro-Side 6 Zabi government on U.C. 0077 and the mysterious accidental death of the mayor of Granada. It was rumored that Zeon was now building its own space battleships and even developing special mobile weapons, which they called mobile suits, leading to whispers of a coming war.  However, the high-ranking officials in Jaburo wanted a political settlement through negotiations, ensuring peace for the time being."
 ZEO_UC0078_DESC:0 "The strange co-existence between Zeon and the Federation that began with Deikun's death is coming to an end with two technological innovations - the Minovsky Particle and the Mobile Suit - and a single leader with a determined will and a genius political skill. The people of Side 3 are the chosen superior race, and General Gihren's words that he is on a mission to lead humanity.   The people of the people of Zeon are enthused like a divine revelation, and the spirit of the Zeon people has reached the highest climax. War no longer seems inevitable, and the world is watching to see when Zeon will declare war on the Federation."
 EFS_UC0078_DESC:0 "Ever since Gihren Zabi took real power, Zeon has been playing a risky game. Their political maneuvering, which from our point of view appears to be a tightrope walk, is akin to a parent's feeling for their prodigal son. No matter how obsessed they may be with their fanatical delusions or their hopes for a new weapon called a "mobile suit" that has been reported to be sighted again and again, it's all just a small riot in one colony. It is our responsibility as parents at least to make sure they know that only the road to destruction awaits them."
 OTHER_UC0078_DESC:0 "The formation of the pro-Zabi regime in Side 6, the accidental death of the mayor in Granada, and the conflict between Zeon and the Federation have already surfaced involving the Earth's sphere, and each Side and lunar city cannot afford to remain on the sidelines. Whether it should be with the Federation or with Zeon, negotiations continue in space, and the race for survive the coming war has already begun."

 UC0079_NAME:0 "Operation V"
 UC0079_DESC:0 "U.C. 0079 - Side 3, the furthest space colony from Earth, has challenged the Earth Federation government to a war of independence under the guise of the Principality of Zeon. In the past month or so of fighting, the Principality of Zeon and the Federation forces have killed half of their total population. The original expectations of the Principality of \nZeon were incorrect and Operation British, with a massive colony as its weapon, was not the decisive factor in leading to an early end of the war. The Antarctic Conference did not become a ceasefire treaty; it was concluded as a wartime treaty and the war continued. This led Zeon to conduct an invasion of the Earth itself, putting the Federation in a state of crisis.  The hope of the Earth Federation now lies with a top secret program called 'Operation V'"
 ZEO_UC0079_DESC:0 "The tertiary descent operation, carried out to make up for the failure of Operation British, was a brilliant success. One-third of the Earth is now under occupation by the Principality of Zeon and, in addition to new mobile suits, naval and air forces are being deployed in earnest at the arsenals we have acquired on the ground. The Office of the Commander-in-Chief reports that it expects to complete its occupation of the entire planet as early as August. It's only a matter of time before we take direct control of Jaburo, where the Federation's incompetents are nesting, and bring them to justice in the light of day."
 EFS_UC0079_DESC:0 "The dropping of the Zeon colony caused tremendous damage not only to the people living on Earth, but also to the Earth's environment itself. Experts say the earth's rotation speed will increase by 1.2 seconds per hour as a result of the colony drop and the dust and debris from the event will cover the sky for years to come. Even now, Federation ground troops around the world are forced to flee and telegrams are sent to Jaburo incessantly begging for help and instructions. However, Zeon's national power cannot continue to support the logistics from space to Earth, and the initial momentum of the advance is already waning."
 OTHER_UC0079_DESC:0 "U.C. 0079-January 3. The Principality of Zeon invades Sides 1, 2, and 4 as soon as it declares war on the Earth Federation. Each side was destroyed with little to no resistance. In addition, Zeon marched into Granada, leaving it under occupation.  As a final stike on January 7, Zeon invaded and destroyed Side 5 in the Battle of Loum. Only a handful of refugees survived the hell out of each Side and only Side 6 and Von Braun, who had declared neutrality early, remained. The hopes of Zeon as a liberator from the Federation and the independence of the Spacenoids were betrayed in the worst way."
