 efsf_new_relationship_with_colony_desc:0 "Since Zeon Zum Deikun advocated contolism in U.C. 0046, gaining full autonomy has been an aspiration for the spacenoids. We need to reformulate our response to the sides before a second or third Zeon Zum Deikun shows up."

 efsf_relaxation_of_tariffs_desc:0 "The large tariffs imposed by the Federation on behalf of Earth's companies, which are at a huge handicap in terms of transportation costs, have come under severe criticism from the sides and lunar cities. Some economists and analysts point out that federal tariffs are extremely detrimental to the economic growth of humanity as a whole. Maybe we should review this law before it becomes irretrievable."
 efsf_reduction_of_stationed_troops:0 "Reduce Garrison troops"
 efsf_reduction_of_stationed_troops_desc:0 "The only way to make up for the ever-increasing trade deficit since the center of international markets shifted to space is to cut our bloated military spending. The security for each side should be left to the IDF of each side and the garrison forces should be reduced."
 efsf_economic_revival_plan:0 "Plan of Economic Revitalization"
 efsf_economic_revival_plan_desc:0 "As the center of the economy shifted to space in the Universal century, Earth's industries expanded into space one after another. As a result, the economy of [EFS.GetName] has become so heavily dependent on space that the Earth is now reduced to a one-way street. The revival of the global economy is necessary for the future stability of [EFS.GetName]."

 efsf_military-industrial_complex_desc:0 "Companies such as Anaheim Electronics, headquartered at [VBC.GetName], have a history of joint space development with federal forces since the early days of the Universal century, these are large companies with branches on Earth. If we can build a good relationship with them, it will have benefits for Earth's industries."
 efsf_expansion_of_lunar_factory:0 "From Spoons to Space Battleships"
 efsf_expansion_of_lunar_factory_desc:0 "Anaheim Electronics is now the largest company in the Earth-sphere and as the tagline 'From Spoons to Space Battleships' suggests, not only does the company offer products ranging from home products to military weapons but the group's companies range from finance to telecommunications. By collaborating with them, we may be able to create new industries."

 efsf_relaxation_of_hollowing_out_of_industry_desc:0 "Space immigration that was initiated by an ever-growing population and a severe degradation of the global environment, has caused factories on Earth to reduce their operations significantly, with some being abandoned rather than dismantled."
 efsf_special_economic_zone:0 "Special Economic Zone"
 efsf_special_economic_zone_desc:0 "New Hong Kong has been designated a special economic zone, including the Luo Trading Company, which handles East Asian commerce. This makes it one of the best commercial areas on the planet. It's also where Anaheim Electronics Chairman Melanie Hue Carbine once raised himself, and where the aspiring entrepreneurs who dream of the Anaheim of tomorrow gather."
 efsf_focus_on_agriculture:0 "Focus on Agriculture"
 efsf_focus_on_agriculture_desc:0 "Earth-grown produce has become a status symbol of sorts for the wealthy Spacenoids. This boom has recently spread to the middle class and has the potential to become a viable export commodity for the planet. There is a surplus of land available thanks to a reduced population, and reports are coming in that the global environment is recovering. If the government gives subsidies to farmers and encourages the export of agricultural products, there will be great economic growth in this sector."
 efsf_new_industry:0 "Create employment opportunities"
 efsf_new_industry_desc:0 "The [EFS.GetName] government's global produce campaign has paid off, and now massive breadbasket construction has begun across the planet. Due to the creation of job opportunities the unemployment rate is also starting to show signs of improvement."
 efsf_high_tech_leader:0 "Invest in High-tech Industrial sector"
 efsf_high_tech_leader_desc:0 "Investing in high-tech industry is essential to growing a competitive company in the space market. If we can develop new technologies using our abundant natural resources, such as rare metals and rubber, some of which are less common in space, we will have an edge in the market."
 efsf_mass_driver:0 "Mass Driver"
 efsf_mass_driver_desc:0 "The overwhelming disadvantage for Earth's companies competeing in the space market is their transportation costs. The cost of launching goods out of the Earth's gravity makes the price much less competitive. Efforts should be made to increase the operational efficiency of the mass driver, and efforts should be made to substantially lower launch costs."
 efsf_parents_of_earth_sphere:0 "Guardian of Earth Sphere"
 efsf_parents_of_earth_sphere_desc:0 "The steel machine that had been asleep for so long was now fully awake. New industries have sprung up, and the shadows of transports carrying our products can be seen everywhere in space.

 efsf_earth_revitalization_plan:0 "Plan of Earth Restoration"
 efsf_earth_revitalization_plan_desc:0 "Before the Universal Century, Earth's population exceeded 9 billion and the planet's environmental problems were dire, but now almost a century after the start of the space migration project, reports are emerging that the planet's environment is recovering. Now that the space immigration project is proving to be effective the colony-building program, which has remained frozen since U.C. 0051, should be restarted."
 efsf_promotion_of_side7_construction_project:0 "Push the construction project of Side 7"
 efsf_promotion_of_side7_construction_project_desc:0 "With frequent project reviews, the construction of [SI7.GetAdjective] has been slow to progress, apparently due to sabotage by some pro-earth supremacist lawmakers.

 efsf_resumption_of_immigration_plan:0 "Immigration Policies Council"
 efsf_resumption_of_immigration_plan_desc:0 "The Council on Immigration Issues is the body that resolves and mediates all issues related to the space immigration business, and they are said to be the largest [EFS.GetName] government interest group, with a great deal of influence in deciding when and who to immigrate. In moving forward with immigration to [SI7.GetAdjective], there is a need for screening more than ever before."
 efsf_transfer_of_government_function:0 "Move the Government's Functions"
 efsf_transfer_of_government_function_desc:0 "The idea of moving the government's functions of the Earth Federation into space had been postponed indefinitely by the painful incident of the bombing of the Prime Minister's Office, Laplace, in the first year of the Universal Century but it can be said that this has given some Spacenoids the misconception that space immigration is an abstention policy. We must once again push for the transfer of government's functions to space in order to complete the space immigration project."
 efsf_colony_autonomy_law:0 "Legislation of Colony Autonomy Law"
 efsf_colony_autonomy_law_desc:0 "The Colony Autonomy Improvement Act, once submitted to the [EFS.GetAdjective] Parliament by Zeon Zum Deikun and scrapped, would have granted significant autonomy to the Spacenoids. If we promote immigration into space in the future, we will need to allow more autonomy for each side than ever before, while at the same time easing the burden on the [EFS.GetName] government."
 efsf_new_earth_federation:0 "New Earth Federation"
 efsf_new_earth_federation_desc:0 "As the space immigration project nears completion people who have remained on Earth, including the [EFS.GetName] government are leaving the planet. The time when humanity can truly fully advance into space is just around the corner. In that new age, the conflict between Earthoids and Spacenoids will be a thing of the past."
 efsf_technology_sharing:0 "Sharing Technologies"
 efsf_technology_sharing_desc:0 "The [EFS.GetName] government-led venture into space has contributed greatly to the development of science and technology, but in the future it should not only be led by the [EFS.GetName] government but should also cooperate with other sides and the lunar cities in the field of science and technology."
 efsf_elenism:0 "Ere-ism"
 efsf_elenism_desc:0 "When mankind first succeeded in building colonies and realized that our scientific prowess had made the creation of a life-giving environment possible, we once thought was this only possible for God, the idea of "ere-ism" was born, this is the idea that the Earth is the source of life and was an inviolable sacred place and that all mankind should advance into space. More than half a century later, we are finally being reborn from being protected by the Earth to being protector of the Earth."
 efsf_army_reform:0 "Reform the Army"
 efsf_army_reform_desc:0 "The greatest apparatus of violence in human history is the army that the [EFS.GetName] government needed to powerfully promote its space immigration enterprise. It has continued to swell in the absence of enemies since the [EFS.GetName] government's declaration of 'the disappearance of conflict from the face of the Earth' at U.C. 0022, and is now the site of [EFS.GetAdjective] government's greatest corruption and devastation."

 efsf_review_of_personnel_system_desc:0 "For the [EFS.GetName] army, which has not experienced major combat since the declaration of the annihilation of the conflict at U.C. 0022, system of promotion is based on reputation and is determined by their bargaining power and documentation. A review the current promotion system in which young and talented field officers are not properly evaluated is essential to correct [EFS.GetAdjective] military morale and discipline."
 efsf_eradication_of_corruption:0 "Eradication of Corruption"
 efsf_eradication_of_corruption_desc:0 "Military personnel are bureaucratized with factional politics running the gamut, collusion with military-industrial conglomerates, and openly subordinated to public corporations.

 efsf_restructuring_of_staff_headquarters_desc:0 "A new situation is now emerging within the [EFS.GetAdjective] military, having fundamentally reformed the HR system and reviewed the collusive nature of the industry. By reorganizing the General Staff, which has been an elite group of [EFS.GetAdjective] forces and has held an absolute position, the brains of the [EFS.GetAdjective] forces will be reborn."
 efsf_military_expansion:0 "Expansion of Armaments"
 efsf_military_expansion_desc:0 "The reform of the [EFS.GetName] army was a great pain, but now the tumor has been taken removed. We should once again turn our gaze outward. A new army must be formed as soon as possible to be the true guardians of the Earth's sphere."
 efsf_disarmament:0 "Reduction of Armaments"
 efsf_disarmament_desc:0 "The reform of the [EFS.GetName] army was a great pain, but now the tumor has been removed. From now on [EFS.GetName] should take a coordinated line with each side and mutually bear the burden on the defense."

 efsf_dont_admit_zeons_independence_desc:0 "Having once declared independence under Zeon Zum Deikun, [ZEO.GetName] has continued to carry on that policy since becoming the dictatorship of the Zabi family. At the time the Federation acquiesced to the dictatorship of the Zabi family, it has tolerated a certain amount of political performance, but it should be made clear that the emphasis with each side and the lunar city is important as we move forward with our space-going business, and that we will never recognize the independence of [ZEO.GetAdjective]."
 efsf_general_meeting:0 "Earth Federation General Meeting"
 efsf_general_meeting_desc:0 "The Earth Federation Parliament was monopolized by Earth's members, and the members of each side and lunar city were kept out of the mosquito net. (In the past, Zeon Zum Deikun presented the Colony Autonomy Development Act to Congress on behalf of Side 3, but it was overwhelmingly rejected) In considering future relationships with each side and lunar city, it is necessary to allow them a certain ammount of say and emphasize to create a venue for future space development, assuming their trust and active participation in [EFS.GetName]."
 efsf_zeon_surrounding_net:0 "Zeon Encirclement Network"
 efsf_zeon_surrounding_net_desc:0 "By adopting a resolution condemning [ZEO.GetAdjective] at the Earth Federation General Assembly, we succeeded in diplomatically isolating [ZEO.GetAdjective]. It's time for humanity to come together and address the [ZEO.GetAdjective] problem."

 efsf_show_to_colony_desc:0 "Since U.C. 0059, we have continued to impose economic sanctions on [ZEO.GetName], but have not been able to keep pace with other sides sympathetic to [ZEO.GetName] or the Lunarians who will sell you anything as long as you pay them, and our sanctions have not been effective enough. This is a serious diplomatic violation and will need to be protested to the respective prime ministers."

 efsf_enhancement_of_stationed_units_desc:0 "[ZEO.GetAdjective] is building its own space ships, and their Defense Force's budget is growing year after year.

 efsf_tariff_enhancement:0 "Tariff Increase"
 efsf_tariff_enhancement_desc:0 "Trade frictions with the Spacenoids are getting worse and Earth's economy has become significantly space-dependent.

 efsf_appeasement_policy_for_zeon:0 "Appeasement Policy to Zeon"
 efsf_appeasement_policy_for_zeon_desc:0 "Despite [ZEO.GetAdjective]'s repeated political adventures in favor of the [EFS.GetName] government's lukewarm response, lawmakers who don't want to stoke the emotions of the Spacenoids or who don't want war, want their problems with [ZEO.GetAdjective] to be resolved through negotiations. If we respond in a way that provokes them, it could threaten the power base of the current government. All is as the people will."
 efsf_enhance_monitoring_network:0 "Ramp up surveillance network"
 efsf_enhance_monitoring_network_desc:0 "The activity of [ZEO.GetAdjective's] warships and some of the humanoid maneuvering devices that have been sighted has been increasing in recent years and it's clear that [ZEO.GetAdjective] is up to something. Increasing patrol fleets, surveillance and inspections colony ports will help clarify the purpose."
 efsf_enhanced_economic_sanction:0 "Tighten Economic Sanctions"
 efsf_enhanced_economic_sanction_desc:0 "Despite repeated warnings and negotiations against [ZEO.GetAdjective], it is no longer clear that they are continuing on the path to war. Economists are questioning the effectiveness of economic sanctions, but our attitude toward [ZEO.GetAdjective] needs to be clarified."
 efsf_reciving_asteroid:0 "Prohibit Possession of Asteroids"
 efsf_reciving_asteroid_desc:0 "The Asteroids Retention Act, once created during the heyday of the space immigration business, allowed Sides to retain asteroids for the purpose of mining resources for colony building, but it was a loophole-ridden law and as it stands, it's clear that [ZEO.GetAdjective] is using it for other purposes. Perhaps the law should be reviewed and [ZEO.GetAdjective]'s source of resources cut off."

 efsf_watching_expressions_desc:0 "Since the establishment of the [EFS.GetName] Space Force, it has been customary for the [EFS.GetAdjective] Force's viewing ceremonies to take place in space. It is a symbol of the glorious development of the new space battleships being built one after another and a symbol of confidence and awe for the colonies. The viewing ceremony at Lunar Two is the proof that the [EFS.GetName] forces are the guardians of the Earth realm."
 efsf_support_anti_zabi_faction:0 "Eliminate the Dictatorship of the Zabi family"
 efsf_support_anti_zabi_faction_desc:0 "When the decision was made to eliminate Zeon Zum Deikun, it was in the best interest of [EFS.GetAdjective] to let House Zabi rule [ZEO.GetAdjective], but it is slowly spinning out of our control in the son's hands. It can be said that the Zabi family is not in control of the people now, but rather is formenting rebellion against [EFS.GetName]. They need a new mentor."

 efsf_rescission_of_economic_sanctions:0 "Remove Economic Sanctions"
 efsf_rescission_of_economic_sanctions_desc:0 "Since the imposing of economic sanctions in U.C. 0059, the lifting of economic sanctions has been an important political issue for [ZEO.GetName] and the most important card in our negotiations with them. Perhaps this important card should be used in a deal that is not a loss to both parties."
 efsf_approved_dictatorship:0 "Approve the Zabi Family's Dictatorship"
 efsf_approved_dictatorship_desc:0 "The justification for the dictatorship of the House of Zabi is the nomination statement of his successor, allegedly made by Zeon Zum Deikun in his dying days. Naturally, the absolute democracy [EFS.GetName] does not allow the nomination of successors by sheikhs, and officially, [ZEO.GetAdjective] is supposed to remain without a sheikh. As we continue to negotiate with [ZEO.GetAdjective] in the future, we should try to resolve this anomaly so that we can have normal negotiations."

 efsf_building_competition:0 "Naval arms race"
 efsf_building_competition_desc:0 "[ZEO.GetName]'s military spending is getting bigger every year to make up a little bit of the gap in strength between them and our space fleet. The proposed budget that was released was probably an amended one, and in fact it should have been substantial, including a budget that was treated as confidential. If we continue to ride the space battleship building race, the economy of [ZEO.GetName] will eventually stop turning, and the dictatorship of the Zabi family will crumble."
 efsf_leak_plan_rx:0 "Leak the Project RX"
 efsf_leak_plan_rx_desc:0 "The RX plan for the development of the MS is a top secret of the [EFS.GetAdjective] forces, but the fact that we are developing the MS is of course expected by [ZEO.GetAdjective], so the plan itself is of little value. It would be better to confuse [ZEO.GetAdjective] by deliberately spreading inaccurate information."
 efsf_regime_change:0 "Regime Change"
 efsf_regime_change_desc:0 "The Zabi family dictatorship in Side 3, which began with the death of Zeon Zum Deikun, initially benefited the [EFS.GetName] government by taking a coordinated line with Degwin Sod Zabi, but now the proliferation of [ZEO.GetAdjective] is too much to behold.

However, several recent sighting reports support that [ZEO.GetAdjective] is seriously researching this weapon. Although skeptics still prevail within the [EFS.GetAdjective] military, we are certainly behind [ZEO.GetAdjective] in this area and we too will need to promote basic research on giant humanoid weapons."

Minovsky, has already been used militarily in the form of mega-particle cannons and thermonuclear reactors, but its property of attenuating all radio waves and causing electronic devices to malfunction has been dismissed as inadequate for military use beyond being able to protect its own armament, and [ZEO.GetAdjective] is receiving information that new tactics to exploit this property are being seriously studied. We should be doing more research."
 efsf_plan_rx:0 "Project RX"
 efsf_plan_rx_desc:0 "We're behind [ZEO.GetAdjective] in mobile suit development. Although military leaders are still skeptical about the military usefulness of the MS, they have decided that it is on the [EFS.GetAdjective's] honor to continue to be beaten by the [ZEO.GetAdjective] in this area, and have decided to promote comprehensive research on this new weapon, including basic research and development of mobile suits, countermeasures, and methods of operation."

 efsf_plan_v:0 "Operation V"
 efsf_plan_v_desc:0 "The reason why we were defeated in the initial battle against [ZEO.GetAdjective] despite the overwhelming difference in strength was that our [EFS.GetAdjective] fleet was completely unable to respond to tactics that centered on disabling electronic devices with Minovsky particles and visual combat that utilized the mobility of the mobile suits. Although Jaburo's General Staff, which does not know the field does not approve, any further defeats may mean that the front will not be able to be sustained, and now there is not a moment to lose, and we must vigorously promote this operation for the purpose of MS development, operation, and tactical research."
 efsf_focus_on_beam_equipment:0 "Focus on Beam Weapons"
 efsf_focus_on_beam_equipment_desc:0 "The mega-particle artillery weapons that MS can carry will give our troops a significant advantage in anti-MS combat because their bullet speed is nearly the speed of light, making them difficult to evade and their steady attack power is not affected by pilot proficiency."

 efsf_focus_on_amu_equipment_desc:0 "Although beam weapons are extremely powerful, their production costs are high, and there are many challenges in the field, such as the small number of shots that can be charged and difficult maintenance. In order to maintain a vast front, it is inevitable that a full range of firearms will be available, and there is an urgent need to establish a system for mass production of live-fire weapons for MS."
 efsf_focus_on_sniper_ms:0 "Sniper MS Battalion"
 efsf_focus_on_sniper_ms_desc:0 "A beam weapon with a high bullet speed and little decay in power from distance is an extremely sniper-friendly firearm. An MS-centered sniper force equipped with specialized sniper equipment would be able to cover a large area of the battlefield in small numbers."

 efsf_focus_on_artilery_ms_desc:0 "Based on the feedback from the RX plan, the ability to provide medium and long-range artillery support to the MS, which is primarily a close-quarters combat field, would allow it to provide effective artillery support even under Minovsky particles."
 efsf_innovation_of_war:0 "War Has Changed"
 efsf_innovation_of_war_desc:0 "It is safe to say that two new technologies, the Minovsky particle and the mobile suit, have fundamentally changed the conventional wisdom of warfare in the future. Our defeat in the early stages of the war against [ZEO.GetName] stems from a complete lack of understanding of these two new technologies. We should establish a new combat doctrine, even if it means abandoning all other previous combat doctrines."

 efsf_augusta_lab:0 "Augusta Institute"
 efsf_augusta_lab_desc:0 "The Augusta Laboratory, which is attached to the North American base in Augusta, is home to a number of outstanding scientists who continue the tradition of the former American scientific community. The institute has submitted a special budget proposal for Newtype research and the development of a dedicated Newtype MS."
 efsf_high_mobility:0 "Emphasize Mobility"
 efsf_high_mobility_desc:0 "The RX-78, developed in an attempt to determine the limits of a mobile suit's performance through the RX project, is a masterpiece that demonstrates its ability to fully fulfill its purpose. Based on the feedback gained from the practical operation of this aircraft, the development department decided to focus on mobility as the direction of future mobile suit development."
 efsf_versatility:0 "Emphasize Versatility"
 efsf_versatility_desc:0 "Developed by the RX project to determine the limits of mobile suit performance, the RX-78 is a masterpiece that demonstrates that it is capable of fully fulfilling it's purpose. Based on the feedback gained from the practical operation of this aircraft, the development department has decided that the direction of future mobile suit development will be based on versatility."
 efsf_white_devil:0 "White Devil"
 efsf_white_devil_desc:0 "The RX-78's remarkable battle results have now spread not only to the [EFS.GetAdjective] forces, but also to the [ZEO.GetAdjective] forces, and apparently the soldiers of the [ZEO.GetAdjective] are afraid of these so called 'white devils'."
 efsf_focus_on_mass_production_machines:0 "Focus on Mass Production"
 efsf_focus_on_mass_production_machines_desc:0 "A full-scale mass production MS will be developed based on feedback from the prototype experimental aircraft developed by the RX project. The armor and equipment are greatly simplified, and the pilot's ejection mechanism with the core block system is also eliminated, resulting in lower production costs and higher productivity."
 efsf_augusta_factory:0 "Augusta Arsenal"
 efsf_augusta_factory_desc:0 "The North American base at Augusta inherits the foundation and know-how of the former United States of America's weapons development, and its development capabilities make it one of the top weapons arsenals for the [EFS.GetAdjective] forces on the ground. The development department at Augusta Arsenal has submitted a unique refurbishment plan for the RGM-79 based on the combat data obtained from Operation V."
 efsf_development_of_MS_for_local_warfare:0 "Development Cold Climate MS"
 efsf_development_of_MS_for_local_warfare_desc:0 "With [ZEO.GetAdjective]'s invasion of Earth, the battle lines have expanded rapidly in space and on the ground, reaching environments that are difficult for conventional weapons and MS to cope with such as inside colonies, just below the equator on the ground and in polar regions. We will focus on developing an MS dedicated to these localized operational areas."
 efsf_development_of_MS_for_custom:0 "Development Custom-use MS"
 efsf_development_of_MS_for_custom_desc:0 "The production RGM-79 has significantly reduced armor and armor specs compared to the RX series, but some pilots are beginning to show a high degree of aptitude for MS operation. If we develop a high-performance aircraft for their ace pilots, we'll be able to expect higher combat results."
 efsf_jablo_factory:0 "Jaburo Arsenal"
 efsf_jablo_factory_desc:0 "Jaburo, the [EFS.GetAdjective] army's headquarters, is also the largest weapons factory in the [EFS.GetAdjective] arsenals. The development department at Jaburo Arsenal has submitted a unique refurbishment plan for the RGM-79 based on the battle data obtained from Operation V."
 efsf_next_generation_ms:0 "Next-Generation MS"
 efsf_next_generation_ms_desc:0 "Our military's MS development has continued to make great progress since the beginning of the war, but the minor changes to the RX-78 and the high performance of the RGM-79 are coming to a head. Therefore, the development department has proposed several ambitious projects that will rethink the design philosophy of MS itself. We will focus on the development of a prototype experimental aircraft with the aim of developing a next-generation MS that will have much higher armor and power than previous MSs, while also placing less burden on the pilot."
 efsf_strength_improvement_plan:0 "Armaments Procurement Plan"
 efsf_strength_improvement_plan_desc:0 "The Force Improvement Plan is a budget proposal that is developed on an annual basis based on the arms buildup plan of the [EFS.GetAdjective], which is done every ten years. On the basis of this budgetary allocation, the war effort will be developed for land, sea, air and space forces. In which areas should we prioritize our investments?"
 efsf_scvx_plan:0 "Project SCV-X"
 efsf_scvx_plan_desc:0 "The development of a space carrier capable of carrying airborne fighters was a plan that had been shelved in consideration of stimulating the various sides and lunar cities, although the plan itself had existed before. Given the recent tensions with [ZEO.GetAdjective], the usefulness of a space carrier that can be deployed for raids with a relatively small fleet formation is considered to be extremely high."
 efsf_vinson_plan:0 "Vinson Plan"
 efsf_vinson_plan_desc:0 "The number of [EFS.GetAdjective] fleets lost in the initial battle with [ZEO.GetAdjective] forces is so great that the Earthosphere is now a garden of [ZEO.GetAdjective] fleets. [ZEO.GetAdjective] fleets dropping supplies from their home countries are coming and going without any resistance, although the few remaining EFSF fleets have gathered at Lunar Two and managed to maintain their airspace. The realignment of the [EFS.GetAdjective] military space fleet is an urgent need."
 efsf_war_is_never_change:0 "War Never Changes"
 efsf_war_is_never_change_desc:0 "Our defeat in the early stages of the war against [ZEO.GetName] was largely due to the cowardly raids and inhumane maneuvers of [ZEO.GetAdjective]. They are just a terrorist group and we should not be fighting on the same ground. We need to rebuild the Space fleet as soon as possible and bring it to a decisive battle between the fleets."
 efsf_focus_on_mainstay_fighter:0 "Focus on Fighters"
 efsf_focus_on_mainstay_fighter_desc:0 "The FF-3 Saberfish, the current mainstay fighter, is a high-altitude fighter that was officially adopted by U.C. 0071. It was originally developed for the Space Force but was not adopted and is a modified version of the Air Force's airborne fighter. Although it has sufficient performance as a fighter, due to the preceding circumstances the Air Force has suggested that the next mainstay fighter should be developed."
 efsf_air_superiority:0 "Air Superiority"
 efsf_air_superiority_desc:0 "[ZEO.GetAdjective] forces' blitzkrieg Earth-Dropping Operations have caused some of the Air Force bases to fall into the hands of [ZEO.GetAdjective], and [ZEO.GetAdjective] forces are deploying their own aircraft from our former bases. On the pride of our [EFS.GetAdjective] Air Force, we will not let [ZEO.GetAdjective] do what they want in the skies of the Earth"
 efsf_focus_on_amphibious_assault_ship:0 "Focus on Assault Spaceship"
 efsf_focus_on_amphibious_assault_ship_desc:0 "The Pegasus class, developed in the SCV-X program, proved that assault operations with a small fleet of combined MS and battleships could be an extremely effective tactic. In response to this result, it is suggested that subsequent construction should proceed with the production of a more improved type."
 efsf_focus_on_bomber:0 "Focus on Tactical Bombers"
 efsf_focus_on_bomber_desc:0 "In fighting [ZEO.GetAdjective] forces on the ground, it is clear that we have the advantage in air power over [ZEO.GetAdjective] forces that have not had an air force before. The influence of the Minovsky particles has rendered precision-guided air-to-surface missiles useless, but there's no doubt that bombing from the air will be an effective tactic against ground-based MSs that don't have as much mobility as they do in space."
 efsf_focus_on_multipurpose_fighter:0 "Develop Multirole Fighters"
 efsf_focus_on_multipurpose_fighter_desc:0 "The FF-X7 Core Fighter developed in the RX program was the first [EFS.GetAdjective] fighter to have a thermonuclear reactor and although it was developed as a multi-role aircraft, its complex deformation mechanism led to the decision for it to have an extremely short range. To overcome this problem, a plan has been proposed to install a booster on the core fighter and improve its overall performance as a multi-role machine."
 efsf_empty_supply_path:0 "Aerial Logistics"
 efsf_empty_supply_path_desc:0 "[ZEO.GetAdjective]'s ground disruptions from Earth-Dropping Operations have also paralyzed the logistics lines on the ground, due in part to the impact of the Minovsky particles on the communications infrastructure. In order to overcome this situation and get the necessary personnel and supplies quickly, we will focus on aerial transport by a large formation of transport aircraft."
 efsf_focus_on_mbt:0 "Focus on MBTs"
 efsf_focus_on_mbt_desc:0 "Since the official adoption of the Type 61 tank in U.C. 0061, the MBTs of the [EFS.GetAdjective] army have gone unreviewed to the present, but now that maintaining security in the colonies has become the primary mission of the [EFS.GetAdjective] army, the focus should be on developing the next main battle tank."
 efsf_earth_counter_strategy:0 "Earth Offensives"
 efsf_earth_counter_strategy_desc:0 "Since the opening of the war, we have always been defensive. With a third of the ground occupied by [ZEO.GetAdjective] and many of our countrymen calling for help, we were unable to carry out a satisfactory counter-attack operation. The question now is the very reason for the existence of [EFS.GetName]. We can no longer allow [ZEO.GetAdjective] to overrun the ground any longer. We're going to start the fight to get the Earth back."
 efsf_diversion_of_MS_technology:0 "Apply MS Technology"
 efsf_diversion_of_MS_technology_desc:0 "In order to overcome the overwhelmingly low number of MS deployments compared to the [ZEO.GetAdjective], we will focus on developing a combat vehicle specialized for anti-MS combat, based on the RTX-44 developed by the Army as the next MBT."
 efsf_mobile_headquarters:0 "Mobile HQ"
 efsf_mobile_headquarters_desc:0 "The spray of Minovsky particles has created a fog that is now invisible on the battlefield. Under sighted combat, which was unthinkable in electronic warfare, tactical decisions must also be made directly at the front. So it is necessary to have a large land warship serve as a command post and take direct command at the front."
 efsf_champion_of_land:0 "King of the Land"
 efsf_champion_of_land_desc:0 "The Type 61 tank, as its name suggests, is the MBT of the [EFS.GetAdjective] army that was formally adopted by the U.C. 0061 warfighting program, and is the tank produced by the [EFS.GetAdjective] army in the highest numbers. Even before the advent of the MS, which was already noted as obsolete, it is the king of the land with enough firepower to compete with the [ZEO.GetAdjective] army's MS-06, well-trained pilots and an overwhelming number of vehicles capable of conquering the entire planet."
 efsf_special_force:0 "Anti-Mobile Suit Tactical Squad"
 efsf_special_force_desc:0 "There is no doubt that the tank force is a weapon that can be used against the MS-06, but when it comes to combat, there is also no doubt that the price will be high for us. According to the General Staff's research, it is known from previous battles that a surprise attack to the legs is an extremely effective attack against the MS. It is hoped that by forming a raiding infantry force that specializes in anti-MS warfare, like the anti-tank infantry of the past, they will be able to achieve higher results with less attrition."
 efsf_coop_with_ms:0 "Coordination with MS"
 efsf_coop_with_ms_desc:0 "Data obtained by operating mobile suits show that they are more effective when operated alongside armored vehicles that specialize in search and communications than forces composed solely of mobile suits."
 efsf_quantity_battle:0 "Material Superiority"
 efsf_quantity_battle_desc:0 "The current war with [ZEO.GetName] is showing the appearance of a prolonged war with both [EFS.GetName] and [ZEO.GetAdjective] lacking decisiveness as the entire planet has become a battlefield due to [ZEO.GetAdjective]'s Earth-Dropping Operations but if it continues to be a mass war, it is clear that [EFS.GetName] has the advantage over [ZEO.GetAdjective] who needs to transport people and supplies from the mainland, and we should fight in a way that forces the enemy to atrophy while minimizing our own damage."
 efsf_federal_navy_tradition:0 "Federal Navy Traditions"
 efsf_federal_navy_tradition_desc:0 "Since the declaration of the annihilation of conflict on Earth at U.C. 0022, the Federal Navy, with no place of activity in space, has continued to shrink in size and while many of the sailors have moved their voyages to space, there are still men of the sea who continue to stick to the sea and uphold the discipline and traditions of the Federal Navy."
 efsf_navy_reconstruction_plan:0 "Naval Reconstruction"
 efsf_navy_reconstruction_plan_desc:0 "[ZEO.GetAdjective]'s invasion of the planet has caused extensive damage to the sea, many naval bases have been destroyed and the [EFS.GetAdjective] Navy has been devastated. We must rebuild the [EFS.GetAdjective] navy as soon as possible."
 efsf_diversion_of_mobile_pod_for_space:0 "Conversion of Space-Use Mobile Pods"
 efsf_diversion_of_mobile_pod_for_space_desc:0 "[EFS.GetAdjective] naval ships and docks were badly damaged by [ZEO.GetAdjective]'s invasion of Earth operation. It would take a long time to completely rebuild the fleet, so a plan to convert the airtight space mobile pods for the Navy has been proposed by the development department as a measure to make up for the urgency of the situation."
 efsf_navy_MS_troops:0 "Naval MS Unit"
 efsf_navy_MS_troops_desc:0 "The success of the underwater mobile pods proves that mobile suits can be useful underwater. It seems certain that [ZEO.GetAdjective], which doesn't have a Navy to begin with, will also develop underwater mobile suits in the sense that it should counter this development."
 efsf_aircraft_carrier_fleet:0 "Carrier Task Force"
 efsf_aircraft_carrier_fleet_desc:0 "Aircraft carriers have been a mainstay of the navy since before the space century. It is the [EFS.GetName] Navy's Himalayan-class regular aircraft carrier that deserves to be the hegemon of the sea."
 efsf_mare_nostrum:0 "Mare Nostrum"
 efsf_mare_nostrum_desc:0 "The ocean, which occupies 70% of the Earth's surface, is a symbol of the Earth, and we cannot let the [ZEO.GetAdjective]'s forces do what they please. Our Federal Navy is the ruler of the sea."
 efsf_focus_on_submarine_corps:0 "Expand the Submarine Fleet"
 efsf_focus_on_submarine_corps_desc:0 "The naval-tech-poor [ZEO.GetAdjective] forces are conducting a commerce-destroying operation with a makeshift submarine fleet. We also need to build up our submarine fleet to counter them."
 efsf_navy_raider:0 "Convoy Raiding"
 efsf_navy_raider_desc:0 "Securing and transporting supplies on the ground by the [ZEO.GetAdjective] military has always been a matter of life and death, and sea transport is no exception. Disrupting maritime transport and cutting off supply lines will be the shortest route to victory."
 efsf_sea_lane_defeat:0 "Defend Sea Lanes to the Last"
 efsf_sea_lane_defeat_desc:0 "Without a full-fledged navy, [ZEO.GetAdjective] forces are conducting guerrilla-like commerce-destroying operations using submarines and underwater mobile suits. Now that the front lines are expanding across the globe, securing maritime transport routes is a renewed priority for the Navy."
 efsf_focus_on_screen_ship:0 "Strengthen Screen Fleet"
 efsf_focus_on_screen_ship_desc:0 "It will take many years to rebuild a navy devastated by [ZEO.GetAdjective]'s invasion of Earth campaign, but it is imperative to protect the few mainstays and transports that will survive the immediate war, and to increase the number of direct guard ships that can readily respond to large areas of the sea."
 efsf_fleet_escort:0 "Convoy Escort"
 efsf_fleet_escort_desc:0 "As we begin a full-scale offensive operations on Earth, the Army is planning several beach landing operations and has asked the Navy to escort the transports."

 ZEO_theory_of_spacenoid_supremacy_desc:0"I have become convinced that there is no longer a moment to spare. Since we can't expect the [EFS.GetName] government to act in a self-cleansing manner, it is the fate of Spacenoids to take over the reins. The question now is not whether it is a [ZEO.GetAdjective] citizen or a [EFS.GetName] citizen. It's either an earthnoid or a spacenoid. It's time for all Spacenoids to stand up for Zeonism!
