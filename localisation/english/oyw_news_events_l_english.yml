  news.1.d:0 "After wavering over the merits of the system of total control for life and the Sovereigndom, which recognized the substantial Zabi dictatorship, the abolitionists had a slight majority in today's session. This marked the end of the dictatorship of the Zabi family that had lasted since U.C. 0069. \nThe new [ZEO.GetAdjective] prime minister, Darcía Baharó, has indicated his policy of advancing a Side-cooperative line, saying, I want to restore the Zeonism that has been distorted by the Zabi family to its original form and I will work closely with other sides to consider future actions. \n There are already  reports that supporters of the Zabi family, ardent followers, and some military officials have gone underground, so political turmoil seems inevitable."

Side 3 is currently under the dictatorship of the Zabi family and the change of the prime minister is a form of parliamentary endorsement of the Sovereign's decision. \nDegwin Sod Zabi, a comrade of Zeon Zum Deikun, who once advocated Zeonism and was also known as Rasputin in the Age of the Universal Century, became Prime Minister when Deikun died mysteriously, but later passed the position to his son, Degwin, who called himself the Sovereign. \nWith Degwin Sodo Zabi as prime minister once again, it is likely that there will be some policy changes within Side 3."
