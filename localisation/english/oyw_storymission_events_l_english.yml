In addition if the robbery was impossible they were ordered to destroy it at any cost. Prior reconnaissance revealed that the base had a shuttle launch pad and Hardie, the commander, thought that the plan was to use the shuttle to transport the Gundam into space. Leaving the diversionary attack on the base to Misha's MSM-03C Hi-Gogg, Captain Hardie and three others entered through the underground submarine dock and headed directly for the shuttle base.\n\nWhen the three mobile suits arrived at the shuttle base despite encountering fierce resistance from the [EFS.GetAdjective] forces, the container carrying the new weapon was just about to be loaded onto the shuttle. A platoon of the [EFS.GetAdjective]'s RGM-79D GM cold districts type tried desperately to defend against the three mobile suits that were trying to secure the container. While this stalemate was going on, the containers were being loaded onto the shuttle and were ready to be launched. Hardie decides that it is no longer possible to secure the container and orders Andy to destroy the shuttle. Hardie and Garcia jump out of cover and launch a bold attack on the GMs. Andy didn't miss the momentary disruption in the coordination of the three GMs as they split up to deal with the enemy mobile suits. He jumped out of the cover and fired the hand missile attached to the MSM-03C Hi-Gogg. The missile hit the shuttle and exploded along with the container. Andy's mobile suit was blown away by the impact of the blast.\n\nWhen Andy noticed that the roar and blast had subsided and the sound of gunfire had died down, he smiled despite being in the middle of a mission, knowing that Hardie and Garcia had successfully neutralized the GM. Even though they hadn't been able to steal it, the plan Hardie had set up was perfect again, and they had succeeded in destroying the target with great teamwork. Although the Cyclops team was much smaller than it had been in the early days of the war, Andy was convinced that the current Cyclops team was the strongest in the world and that with this group, any operation would be a success. However as Andy looks for his colleague, he sees Hardie getting out of his mobile suit and holding Garcia's body, which has stopped moving, and yelling."

In addition, if the robbery was impossible, they were ordered to destroy it at any cost. Preliminary reconnaissance revealed that the base had a shuttle launch pad attached and was defended by at least two platoons of a modified GM. Hardie, the commander, thought that the plan was to use the shuttle to transport the Gundam into space. Judging that the resistance of the [EFS.GetAdjective] forces would be fierce if they attacked the base, he changed the formation of his troops from the MSM-03C Hi-Gogg, which excelled in mobility, to the MSM-07E Z'gok-E, which excelled in firepower and armor. Leaving the diversionary attack on the base to Misha's MSM-03C Hi-Gogg, Captain Hardie and three others entered through the underground submarine dock and headed directly for the shuttle base.\n\nWhen the three mobile suits arrived at the shuttle base despite encountering fierce resistance from the [EFS.GetAdjective] forces, the container carrying the new weapon was just about to be loaded onto the shuttle.

While this stalemate was going on, the containers were being loaded onto the shuttle and were ready to be launched. Judging that it would be impossible to secure the container if a stalemate ensued, Hardie ordered Andy and Garcia to cover him and jumped out to secure the container. Although the armor of the Z'gok-E prevents the RGM-79D's 90mm bullpup machine gun to some extent, Hardie's fuselage is gradually distorted by the concentrated fire. As Hardyies Z'gok-E reached the container, Andy and Garcia didn't miss the fact that GM's attack slowed down for a moment, fearing that it might fire on his friends. At about the same time, the two mobile suits jumped out of the shielding and fired a series of mega particle cannons beams at the three GMs while closing the distance furiously.\n\nHardie, who had eliminated the federal soldiers near the container, looked at his colleagues and saw the two Hy-goggs, which had neutralized the three GMs, proudly raising their arms. In the cockpit, Hardie chuckled and took out a cigarette. It was Hardie's way of thoroughly examining and preparing for the mission. This time, they had simply done more preparation than their opponents. This is the way he has been doing it since the formation of the Cyclops Team, and now each and every one of them understands it so well that Hardie doesn't need to give them specific orders. 'It's a good team' Hardie, who never praised himself, said to himself and put his cigarette back in the box."
  warinthepocket_se.01c.d:0 "After discovering that the new [EFS.GetAdjective] Gundam was located at the Arctic base, the [ZEO.GetAdjective] Assault Task Force ordered the special task force 'Cyclops Team' to steal the new Gundam. In addition, if the robbery was impossible, they were ordered to destroy it at any cost. The reconnaissance conducted three months earlier had revealed that the base was divided into two sections, but it was unclear in which of the two sections the new Gundam was hidden. Fearing that the [EFS.GetAdjective] Forces would destroy the new Gundam or escape by air when they learned of the attack on the base, Captain Hardie decided to divide his troops into two and launch an attack at the same time. Misha and Garcia were in charge of the front base that could be attacked from the sea, while Hardie and Andy were in charge of the base that could be entered from the underground submarine dock.\n\nAt the same time that they succeeded in breaking into the underground passageway from the submarine dock, Misha and Garcia's MSM-03C Hi-Gogg's were making a assault landing on the surface. The confusion caused by the sudden attack on the enemy was short-lived, and the [EFS.GetAdjective] forces immediately deployed RGM-79D GM cold districts types to intercept. Hardie and Andy, who were advancing through the underground passage, were also pursued by enemy mobile suits. Hardie decides that his MSM-07E Z'gok-E, which has thicker armor than the MSM-03C Hi-Gogg that Andy rides, is better suited to stalling the enemy, and sends Andy ahead alone. Meanwhile, at the battle on the surface, Misha and Garcia's Hi-Gogg's, which had fully demonstrated their mobility and firepower, were laying waste to the [EFS.GetAdjective]'s GM Platoon. Having half destroyed the base, the two search for the new Gundam, but it is nowhere to be found. Then Hardie receives a message from Andy, who has passed through an underground passage to the surface. What lay beyond the passageway was a [EFS.GetAdjective] shuttle base. At that moment, Hardie thought that he had made a mistake. His prior information was out of date. In the past three months, the Federals had rushed to build a shuttle. Hardie had a hunch that the mission would fail. Sure enough, Andy reported that a container that appeared to be the new Gundam was being loaded onto the shuttle right now. Hardie decides that it is no longer possible to secure the container and authorizes the use of the hand missile unit against the shuttle, but Andy is unable to attack due to the tremendous counterattack of the GM guarding the shuttle. After destroying the enemy mobile suit in the underground passage, Hardy rushes to Andy, but Andy decides that he can't wait for him to arrive, so he ignores Hardie's warning and attacks with missiles. However, it was quicker for GM's 90mm bullpup machine gun to pierce Andy's fuselage than for the missiles to be fired.\n\nJust as Hardie caught up to him, Andy's mobile suit fell backwards and the missiles were fired. The outburst of the missile exploded behind Hardie, and the blast sent his suit tumbling through the corridor entry toward the surface. From the cockpit of the out-of-control aircraft, Hardie watched in dismay as the shuttle rose into space with a roar."

It was widely believed that [SI6.GetAdjective] was able to exist without interference from either [EFS.GetAdjective] or [ZEO.GetAdjective] because of some kind of behind-the-scenes favoritism.\n\nAlfred Izuruha, a boy living in the Ribo Colony of [SI6.GetAdjective], was one of the many boys living in [SI6.GetAdjective]. His conversations with his friends at school are dominated by the war between the [EFS.GetAdjective] and the [ZEO.GetAdjective] and the topic of giant robots called mobile suits. [ZEO.GetAdjective]'s Zaku mobile suit was especially popular because it looked so powerful. While Al is talking with his best friends Chay and Telcott at school as usual, he gets into an argument with his classmate Dorothy, who claims that the [EFS.GetAdjective] army doesn't have any mobile suits, but Al unintentionally lies to her that he has seen an [EFS.GetAdjective] mobile suit. Al and Choi want to prove her wrong somehow, so they plan to sneak in and photograph the [EFS.GetAdjective] mobile suits when Al's estranged father meets him at the spaceport. Although he manages to sneak in, he is disappointed to find that the only thing he was able to photograph was a container and not a mobile suit. But one of the containers contained the new Gundam that the Cyclops team had missed at the Arctic base.\n\nIn the meantime, the [ZEO.GetAdjective] forces, having obtained information about the existence of a secret [EFS.GetAdjective] base in [SI6.GetAdjective], conduct a reconnaissance of [SI6.GetAdjective] to confirm its authenticity. The [ZEO.GetAdjective] forces, convinced of the existence of the base by the quick response of the [EFS.GetAdjective] forces, withdrew quickly after only sporadic fighting, so the colony was not severely damaged, but this was the first time that fighting had taken place within SI6, which had declared its neutrality, and it was an event that made the citizens of [SI6.GetAdjective] realize that they were also a party to the war.\n\nAl, who was watching the battle at school, saw one of the Zaku's crash-landing towards the forest. Without listening to his friends' restraint, Al started running and headed for the forest where the Zaku had crash-landed. There, he finds the figure of the metal giant lying on its side. Excited to see the mobile suit up close, Al turns his camera around. Through the viewfinder, he sees the figure of Bernie, a Zeon soldier, pointing a gun at him."

As the three of them took control of the control room, a Federal soldier approached Bernie. 'You have an accent, where are you from? Are you from Australia?' For a moment there was tension between Hardie and Bernie. 'Yes, I was born and raised in Sydney. I'm sure the city is white with snow by now.' A tactiful Bernie replied in tune, matching tone, and the federal soldier walked away with a satisfied look. After the crisis was over, the three of them went to the hangar and found the RX-78NT-1 Alex lying there undergoing maintenance.\n\nAt the same time, the urban area of Ribo Colony was in chaos due to the sudden appearance of a mysterious mobile suit. The MS-18 Kämpfer, a [ZEO.GetAdjective] base assault mobile suit assembled by the Cyclops Team in the colony, was walking through the crowded streets at night, looking like it belonged there. Surprised by the sudden appearance of the [ZEO.GetAdjective] mobile suit, the [SI6.GetName] Defense Force calls for support from the stationed troops of the [EFS.GetAdjective] Forces. However, due to the recent battle with the [ZEO.GetAdjective] reconnaissance unit, the EFS forces had no mobile suits that could operate, and refused this request. On the contrary, they try to use the [SI6.GetName] Defense Force to buy time to bring in the Gray Phantom assault ship from outside the colony. Refused support, the [SI6.GetName] Defense Force tries to stop  Kämpfer with conventional weapons such as helicopters and missile vehicles, but they are completely outmatched by the 197mm shotguns fired by [ZEO.GetAdjective]'s latest mobile suits, and are destroyed. Just as Misha was about to reach for the skittles he had brought into the cockpit as usual, a mobile suit squadron began to descend from a [EFS.GetAdjective] assault landing ship that had moved into the colony. There were about two platoons of them. Misha did not miss the defenseless state during the descent, and shot down the RX-77D Guncannon Mass Production Type with a shotgun, and then killed two RGM-79G GM Commanders with two shots of Sturmfaust. But even the Kämpfer, which has plenty of armaments, was running low on ammunition. 'It's a good thing we have something worth fighting for.' Misha said, reaching for his skittles as if welcoming the situation.\n\n'Hey, Sydney boy, it's summer in Australia now!' That was the voice of the soldier who had just spoken to Bernie. It was December. It should be summer in the southern hemisphere. The soldier, who felt uncomfortable with this, hurriedly chased after him. Just as he was about to be restrained, Garcia fired his gun at Hardie's signal. Hardie, who had released his restraints, immediately handed the shotgun to Bernie, but he was shot by an Federal soldier who came to his aid. Bernie fights back with the unconscious Hardie in his arms, but even Garcia is deeply wounded, and they are gradually trapped. Garcia, realizing that total annihilation is inevitable at this point, gives up on robbing the Gundam and decides to blow it up. He asks Bernie for backup and starts running towards Alex with the bomb in his hand, but he is shot before he reaches Alex. Garcia collapses and uses the last of his strength to detonate the bomb, which blows itself up, but fails to destroy the mobile suit. Bernie, with Hardie in his arms, tries to escape from the chaos created by the shock and blast of the explosion. As if to replace him, Chris, wearing a normal suit, went to Alex's cockpit to intercept Kämpfer. Just then, with a roar, the roof of the hangar blew off, and a red monoeye glowed dully at the end of the darkness. It was Misha's Kämpfer, which had annihilated the Gray Phantom's mobile suit squad. Chris's Alex, in a prone position, ignited its verniers and slipped out of the hangar, distancing itself from the Kämpfer. Misha, realizing from Alex's movements that the robbery had failed, took the MNG-110 beam machine gun from the large trailer he had pre-positioned while avoiding Alex's Vulcan cannon. 'Come on, I'll teach you how to fight!' Alex, who was undergoing maintenance, did not have its beam rifle with him, so he held up his beam saber and charged towards Kämpfer. But before the saber could cut through Kämpfer's torso, the beam machine gun shattered Alex's armor. Alex collapsed to his knees in a heap. Even so, Misha did not stop firing the beam machine gun. 'Chobham Armor, right?' F.S.W.S project. A system being researched by the [EFS.GetAdjective] military to retrofit additional armaments according to operational use. It was Captain Hardie who discovered that the G-4 project was also a project to develop prototypes for the F.S.W.S. Misha continued to relentlessly pull the trigger on the torso that was exposed from the chobham armor.\n\nBernie managed to escape from the base, but Hardie was already dead. When he suddenly felt the presence of people and pointed his gun at them, he saw Al, who had infiltrated the medical center to help Bernie and the Cyclops team."

At that moment, two gunshots rang out from the control room, and the hangar doors were electronically locked. Hardie fired a series of machine guns at the backs of the Federation soldiers who rushed out. 'Bernie, the enemy is coming!' Hardie handed the shotgun to Bernie. Hardie was then shot by a federal soldier who had rushed from another area. 'Captain!' Bernie wiped out the federal soldiers with his shotgun and supported Hardie's body. 'I'm fine. Bernie, you get in the Alex. When I give the signal, you run.' 'But I'm not leaving the captain.' 'Go!' Hardie threw a smoke grenade into the air, leaned forward and fired his machine gun. Garcia jumped out of the control room with a machine gun in each hand and attacked the federal soldiers without mercy. When Bernie saw that the federal soldiers were momentarily frightened by the newcomer's appearance, he ran toward Alex through the smoke. The moment he ran up the ramp, Bernie saw Garcia's uniform turn bright red as he was shot. 'Come on, Come on, Come on!' Bernie ran as fast as he could through the gunfire.\n\nHardie, who had exhausted his machine guns, returned fire with a Naban 62 pistol, and Garcia, who was lying about 10 meters away, showed no signs of moving. Hardie, his pistol's magazine empty, crouched against the wall. He wanted to move, but he was bleeding so badly that he was losing all feeling in his body. Just when he thought he was done, a roar rang out in the hangar and he heard the screams of the federal soldiers. When Hardie managed to raise his heavy body and looked towards it, He saw the two eyes of the Gundam staring at him as it raised its upper body."

But even the Kämpfer, which has plenty of armaments, was running low on ammunition. 'It's a good thing we have something worth fighting for.' Misha said, reaching for his skittles as if welcoming the situation.\n\n'Hey, Sydney boy, it's summer in Australia now!' That was the voice of the soldier who had just spoken to Bernie. It was December. It should be summer in the southern hemisphere. The soldier, who felt uncomfortable with this, hurriedly chased after him. Just as he was about to be restrained, Garcia fired his gun at Hardie's signal. Hardie, who had released his restraints, immediately handed the shotgun to Bernie, but he was shot by an Federal soldier who came to his aid. Bernie fights back with the unconscious Hardie in his arms, but even Garcia is deeply wounded, and they are gradually trapped. Garcia, realizing that total annihilation is inevitable at this point, gives up on robbing the Gundam and decides to blow it up. He asks Bernie for backup and starts running towards Alex with the bomb in his hand, but he is shot before he reaches Alex. Garcia collapses and uses the last of his strength to detonate the bomb, which blows itself up, but fails to destroy the mobile suit. Bernie, with Hardie in his arms, tries to escape from the chaos created by the shock and blast of the explosion. As if to replace him, Chris, wearing a normal suit, went to Alex's cockpit to intercept Kämpfer. Just then, with a roar, the roof of the hangar blew off, and a red monoeye glowed dully at the end of the darkness. It was Misha's Kämpfer, which had annihilated the Gray Phantom's mobile suit squad. Chris's Alex, in a prone position, ignited its verniers and slipped out of the hangar, distancing itself from the Kämpfer. Misha, realizing from Alex's movements that the robbery had failed, took out a chain mine from the large trailer he had pre-positioned while avoiding Alex's Vulcan cannon. The shot was accurate, but there were many wasted bullets. The pilot must be a rookie with little actual combat experience. 'Come on, I'll teach you how to fight!' Kämpfer's chain mine entangles Alex as he rushes forward with his beam saber, causing a huge explosion. Misha thought he had destroyed it when he saw Alex's armor peel off and he fell to his knees. But as the gray armor, too tacky to be a new type of Gundam, peeled off, what emerged from underneath was a white and blue colored mobile suit. What he thought he had destroyed was the chobam armor, an additional armor developed by the [EFS.GetAdjective] military as part of the F.S.W.S. project, and the Gundam itself was completely unharmed. The 90mm Gatling gun built into Alex's left arm pierced the Kämpfer's armor, and even after the Kämpfer was silenced, Chris couldn't release the trigger.\n\nBernie managed to escape from the base, but Hardie was already dead. When he suddenly felt the presence of people and pointed his gun at them, he saw Al, who had infiltrated the medical center to help Bernie and the Cyclops team."

  warinthepocket_se.04a.d:0 "The [EFS.GetAdjective] garrison headquarters was in an uproar over a [ZEO.GetAdjective] mobile suit that had appeared only a few days after the recent mobile suit fiasco, a modified version of the mobile suit that the [ZEO.GetAdjective] forces called the Zaku. The Zaku seemed to be heading for the Alex's hangar, following the 'river', a mirror section that the colony uses to let in sunlight. The replenishment of the mobile suit units that had been wiped out in the recent battle had yet to arrive. The Alex, the only one that could operate, was not only not yet perfectly adjusted, but was armed only with a beam saber and 500 rounds for the Gatling gun in its right arm. Then, as if to avenge the other day, the [SI6.GetAdjective] Defense Force promptly sent word that they would not be providing support. 'These people only care about themselves!' Stuart, the commander, spat, and ordered Chris, who was waiting in the Alex, to go out. '......' 'Lieutenant Mackenzie, are you all right? Let's go!' '...... Roger that.' If only the [EFS.GetAdjective] hadn't been stationed on this colony. If only we hadn't created the Gundam. The question she've asked herself over and over again has yet to be answered. Was what I've done right? Chris was no longer sure.\n\nAt the same time, Al was on his way to the spaceport with his mother to pick up his father, who had come to live with them again. On the way home, Al learns from his parents' conversation that there was a battle between the [ZEO.GetAdjective] and [EFS.GetAdjective] fleets in [SI6.GetAdjective] space, and that nuclear missiles were found in the surrendered [ZEO.GetAdjective] fleet. 'We don't have to fight anymore. We have to stop Bernie!' Al ran to Bernie, despite his parents' attempts to stop him.\n\nChris followed the Zaku into the forest without listening to Stuart's restraint, but the forest was covered with smoke and she lost sight of the enemy mobile suit. The moment Chris realized it was a trap, she felt something huge moving in front of her, and fired the Gatling gun repeatedly. But there was no response. Chris felt a presence in another direction and aimed the Gatling gun at it, but it was a huge Christmas balloon for advertising. Just as she thought 'Oh no.' a huge figure of a Zaku wielding a heat hawk popped out of the smoke on the right side. The heat hawk cuts off Alex's left arm as she quickly takes a defensive stance. Alex responded to the Zaku's attempt to stop her with a Gatling gun. The 90mm Gatling gun fired from a short distance penetrated the Zaku's armor. Zaku tackled Alex, and the two mobile suits tumbled down the slope of the forest in a tangle.\n\n'Bernie, you don't have to fight anymore!' Al, who had rushed in to stop the fight, runs to Zaku, shouting desperately. The two mobile suits emerge from the forest and face each other, weapons at the ready. In the Zaku's hand was an MMP-80 machine gun. It had been brought in during the initial reconnaissance, but it was broken and had no offensive capabilities. The opponent did not want to cause damage to the city and chose to fight in the forest. It was Bernie's gamble that if that was the case, his opponent might not want to get into a firefight and might challenge him to a melee battle. Alex, which had quickly retracted its Gatling gun, held its beam saber in its right hand and rushed towards Zaku. Zaku also quickly changed his weapon to a heat hawk. 'Bernie!' Al's shout did not reach him due to the roar. Alex charges in a thrusting stance. Zaku swung his heat hawk right across and sliced through Alex's right arm and torso.\n\nWhen Al, who had been knocked unconscious by the impact of Alex's explosion, was woken up by a Federation soldier, the Zaku was not there."

  warinthepocket_se.05a.d:0 "In the Pink Elephant's backyard, Charlie received an urgent message from the [GRA.GetAdjective]. 'The [ZEO.GetAdjective] homeland did not approve of the nuclear attack on [SI6.GetName]. [GRA.GetAdjective] Command has detained Commander Killing and several of his men for treason for attempting to force a nuclear strike. Please continue your mission in Ribo.' Charlie was relieved to know that the crisis had been averted at the last minute. It seems that there are still people left in the upper echelons of the military who can make decent decisions. He couldn't help but think about the Cyclops members who had died, even more so now that he thought about it. Wouldn't the outcome have been different if they had recognized the Cyclops teams capabilities and given them enough support? Finding a way out of a tight spot, a secret strategy to turn the tide... He's noticed a lot of military people like Killing waving these words around in the upper echelons of the military these days. Hardie never used such words, no matter how difficult the situation. Hardie is no longer with us. 'I failed to die again, didn't I? I wonder if that young blonde got out of the colony safely.' As Charlie returned to the counter, polishing his glass as usual, he was lost in thought when he suddenly heard what sounded like an explosion outside.\n\nHe went outside the store, but could only see smoke in the distance. Back inside the store, Charlie went into the backyard and turned on the TV. Two Mobile Suits were facing each other. The mobile suit that seemed to belong to [EFS.GetAdjective] must be the new Gundam that the Cyclops team had been chasing. [ZEO.GetAdjective]'s mobile suit, on the other hand, was the MS-06FZ, commonly known as the Zaku II Kai. It's hard to imagine that the [GRA.GetAdjective], which had called off the nuclear attack, would immediately launch another operation. So is it a member of the Cyclops Team that is riding it? The two mobile suits close the distance. The Zaku's heat hawk swung down and cut off the Gundam's head, but the Gundam's beam saber pierced the Zaku's torso. Immediately afterwards, the Zaku exploded, and the impact cut off the live TV broadcast. Charlie, who had been staring at the screen intently, sighed heavily and stood up.\n\nThe pilot would not have survived the explosion. If it was that young man on board, why didn't he escape? There shouldn't have been a mission like this in the first place. Where did he get that Zaku? The TV, which had stopped broadcasting, was showing the last moments of Zaku's life over and over again. As he stared at the screen, various questions popped into his mind and then disappeared. Eventually, he suddenly felt something strange about the image of Zaku that kept appearing on the screen. Eye. Zaku's mono-eye was facing to the left. It was impossible for him to not be looking at the enemy in front of him. What was that eye looking at in its final moments?"

The fact that they had posed as a delivery to bring in the mobile suit, the fact that they had assembled the mobile suit inside the colony, the details of their mission in [EFS.GetAdjective]'s secret factory and the fact that the military brass was planning a nuclear strike in case the mission failed. Many times Al wanted to take this package to the police station and tell everyone that Bernie had fought for the colonies, but each time he thought better of it.

I've told you everything I know about how this colony became a target for nuclear missiles. If I die, I want you to take this to the police. If the adults believe me to be telling the truth, I think this colony will be saved. I thought about turning myself in directly to the police, but then I realized that would be like running away.

Al felt an unstoppable outpouring of emotions that had been bottled up inside him since that Christmas day. When Dorothy went to call the teacher, his best friend Chay called out to him.

'I'm closing down,' Charlie said, still wiping his hands on his glass. But the customer ignored him and sat down at the counter. 'Can't you hear me?' Charlie looks up and his expression changes to one of surprise. 'Give me a stale beer.' It was the code for contact with Charlie the agent. 'That's a great order.' Charlie replied with a smile, wiping away a tear. 'Are you all right? You were in that Zaku, weren't you? I saw a beam saber pierce the cockpit on TV.' Bernie took off his deep cap and his expression was somewhat fearless. It's not as if he was still a rookie when he arrived here just a few weeks ago. 'It's all thanks to Al and the autopilot system.'\n\nAs he and Alex rolled down the forest slope, Bernie spotted Al's reflection on the edge of the monitor. 'I don't know why he's here!' Quickly switching the Zaku to autopilot, Bernie jumped out of the cockpit. The moment he was about to run toward Al, Alex's beam saber pierced his torso and the Zaku exploded, blowing Bernie into the forest and knocking him unconscious. By chance, broken branches and balloon fragments hid Bernie's body, and he was undetected by the [EFS.GetAdjective] forces.\n\nCharlie couldn't believe that this young man had stayed and fought to protect the colony, but it was truly a miracle that he hadn't died in that situation. 'That's really great luck. That boy named Al saved your life. What kind of boy is he?' 'He's on a reconnaissance mission at the spaceport. 'It' is going to be transported somewhere else.' Charlie has no idea what he is talking about. 'Wait, what's 'It'? What's the mission?' Bernie rose from his seat and took a salute. He said, 'Please inform [GRA.GetAdjective].

  warinthepocket_se.07b.d:0 "More than a week after the Christmas mobile suit incident, Ribo Colony was finally getting back to normal, but when the police announced that they had arrested the [ZEO.GetAdjective] soldiers involved in the series of battles, the colony was once again in turmoil. And as the full extent of the series of battles between the [EFS.GetAdjective] and the [ZEO.GetAdjective] in the supposedly neutral [SI6.GetAdjective] came to light, there was a new shock among the citizens.\n\nAt a press conference, the Ribo police revealed that a [ZEO.GetAdjective] soldier (whose real name was not disclosed) had turned himself in and testified that the entire series of battles had been over a new type of mobile suit that was being built at a secret [EFS.GetAdjective] military base in the colony. This person was a member of the [ZEO.GetAdjective]'s special forces who had infiltrated the colony with orders to rob or destroy the mobile suit, and had not only disguised themselves as civilian contractors to bring the mobile suit to the colony, but had even built them inside the colony. They attempted to rob the new Mobile Suit that was being secretly built at the U.N. Medical Center, but failed and the unit was wiped out, leaving him behind. When his superiors learned of this fact, they decided to destroy the entire colony with nuclear missiles, but this person testified that in order to stop the attack on the colony, he planned to attack the [EFS.GetAdjective] military base with his mobile suit alone, leading to the final battle with the new Gundam. However, this person has not revealed why he switched the mobile suit to autopilot and escaped before the mobile suit was fatally damaged. Authorities have also learned that he had purchased a ticket to Franchesca's before the last battle, but he has not said how or why he did not board the shuttle. In any case, if the testimony of this person is true, it means that the military activities of the [EFS.GetAdjective] and the [ZEO.GetAdjective] were being carried out right next to the lives of the citizens, and this could fundamentally shake the neutrality policy that the government has been promoting. The government has stated that it had no knowledge of the secret [EFS.GetAdjective] military base and plans to formally protest against the [EFS.GetAdjective] and [ZEO.GetAdjective].\n\n'How do you do?' When he looked up from the newspaper at the call, He saw an old man, a regular customer, standing there. Old man sat down next on a park bench, took a glance at the newspaper, and spoke to him.

'Franchesca's is a tourist colony, there's no [EFS.GetAdjective] base there, so it's much safer than here. How about you, Charles? I might still be able to arrange a ticket for you.'
