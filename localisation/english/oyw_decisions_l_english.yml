While they were often given superior equipment, prototype weapons, and generally favored over other units, they were used as guinea pigs for live-fire data collection."

Aboard Zeon's MAN-08 Elmeth, a mobile armor specially designed for Newtype, she used psychic weapons from ultra-long range against the Federation forces gathered in Solomon, inflicting tremendous damage on the regrouping Federation forces. At the time, the Federation forces were unable to analyze the location of the Elmeth or even what was attacking it, and the Federation soldiers who heard the 'la-la-la' sound emitted by the resonant movement of Lalah's sensor and Minovsky particles fell into a panic. This event was passed down among the soldiers as the Ghost of Solomon, and made many Federation soldiers fearful.
