  storymission_story_warinthepocket_tt_delayed:0 "In 1989, six episodes were produced as Gundam's first OVA. The main character is a civilian boy named Al, which is unusual for  Gundam. The OVA depicts how war destroys everyday life through the eyes of the boy and it is highly acclaimed as a work that depicts the One Year War from the perspective of both Bernie, a Zeon soldier and Chris, a Federation soldier.\nAt the end of the One Year War, the Principality of Zeon's war for independence was coming to an end with Zeon's defeat. The Principality of Zeon receives intel that the Federation Forces are developing a new Gundam and orders the elite task force 'Cyclops Team' to retrieve or destroy the suit. The Cyclops team raids the Federation base in the Arctic, where the Gundam is located but the mission fails. Just as they are about to take off the Gundam is loaded onto a shuttle and launches into space. A few days later, Al (Alfred Izuruha) an elementary school student living in Ribo Colony in Side 6, who had declared neutrality and was ostensibly enjoying peace by not supporting either Zeon or the Federation, visits the spaceport to see his estranged father and happens to photograph a container containing the new Gundam. On his way back he is reunited with his neighbor, Chris (Christina MacKenzie) who is a Federation soldier who used to work on Earth. Meanwhile, Zeon intelligence learns of the existence of a secret Federation base in Ribo, which is supposed to be neutral and conducts a reconnaissance mission inside Ribo. The supposedly peaceful colony is plunged into chaos as battle breaks out between the mobile suits of both the Federation and Zeon forces. In the middle of the battle, Al chases after a Zaku that crash-landed in the forest and he is so excited to see it up close for the first time that he turns on his camera. Eventually, Al senses the presence of someone watching him and turns the camera around to see Bernie (Bernard Wiseman), a Zeon soldier, standing with a gun pointed at him."
