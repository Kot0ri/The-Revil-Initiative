Several of them were refitted and served as logistical support."

  ms06_e:0 "Zaku Flipper"
  ms06_e_desc:0 "Based on the MS-06C, this reconnaissance mobile suit is equipped with high-performance optical cameras and various sensors throughout the fuselage. A particularly distinctive head shape is fitted with three super-telephoto optical cameras made by Canom. In the early days of Zeon, the factory lines were limited, and the company was looking at what branches of the military could be replaced by mobile suits. This reconnaissance-type Zaku is an example of this. Due in part to its ease of handling as a mobile suit, it played an active role throughout the One Year War. In particular, at the end of the Great War, he successfully supplemented the Reville fleet by conducting a decisive raid reconnaissance in the Federation's Operation Star One without knowing the Federation's final strike target."
