archetype_sfs_desc:0 "A few months after the descent of the earth and as the Federation forces gradually set up a counterattack, the Zeon General Staff realized that the mobile suits' performance on the ground was not as good as it was in space.  Their huge 18-meter frames were easily detected on the ground, and the strain on their legs as they moved made long-range operations difficult. In order to overcome these disadvantages the idea of a sub-flight system was born, which would allow a mobile suit to be mounted on an aircraft.
