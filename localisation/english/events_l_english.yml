  oyw.1000.d:0 "2023.4.15 Ver 0.2.31\n\nThank you for playing with the ONE YEAR WAR Mod!\n\nCustom rules have been added for One Year War. Custom rules can be set in the scenario selection screen. Use them when you want to adjust the multiplayer or difficulty level.\n\nZeon starts out as a member state of the Federation. In order to start the war, Zeon must make a declaration of independence at the Decision.\nZeon's invasion of Earth operation uses special decisions to deploy divisions directly from the stockpile. Therefore, you should stockpile as much equipment as possible before the start of the war.\n\nInformation about this mod is posted on Twitter (OneYearWarMod). Also, please feel free to participate in bug reports, suggestions, and a community of users on Discord (https://discord.gg/sh2XkJJ).\n\nWe hope you enjoy this mod."

  oyw.1.d:0 "[EFS.GetName] The government has decided to invest in the industrial sector of our city. Soon, construction of the factories and infrastructure will start. While it is true that this investment will not jeopardize our position as a free city and has maintained our distance from the [EFS.GetName] government, it is also true that there will be more pro [EFS.GetAdjective] factions in the city."

  oyw.3.d:0 "[EFS.GetAdjective] The exclusive contract with AE, which had been in coordination with the government, has been officially signed. It is expected that this will give AE a priority for the [EFS.GetAdjective] government's business. Furthermore, the [ZEO.GetAdjective] government has issued a formal statement of protest through its diplomats."
  oyw.3.a:0 "It's clear which way to go."
  oyw.4.t:0 "The company begins investing in the Jupiter fleet business."
  oyw.4.d:0 "The Jupiter fleet project, which the government had been preparing for by allocating a special budget, is finally in full swing. A flotilla of ships built to mine Jupiter's resources, primarily Helium-3, have already left the dock in quick succession and are on their way to Jupiter.  The journey is expected to be a four-year long voyage."
  oyw.4.a:0 "Let's hope they get home safely."
  oyw.5.t:0 "No Longer Investing in the Jupiter Fleet Business."
  oyw.5.d:0 "Following the recent changes in domestic and international conditions, the government has decided to cut its budget for the Jupiter fleet Project. The Jupiter fleet business itself will continue, but it will be significantly reduced in size."
  oyw.5.a:0 "I'm afraid it can't be helped."
  oyw.6.t:0 "[EFS.GetAdjective] Calls for Government to Expose Dissidents"
  oyw.6.d:0 "Recently, the [EFS.GetAdjective] government legislature passed a resolution calling on each Side and Lunar City to step up its crackdown on anti-federal activities in the colonies. In response to this, each municipality is being asked to respond with condemnations and raids on anti-government groups."
  oyw.6.a:0 "We have to obey."
  oyw.6.b:0 "We reject it!"
  oyw.7.t:0 "Incredible Pilots Reported from the Front lines."
  oyw.7.d:0 "Pilots and observers returning from the front lines are reporting that some of the pilots had successfully evaded the enemy ship's megaparticle guns on multiple occasions.  Experts have confirmed that in order to evade a sub-light-speed mega-particle cannon, one must take evasive action that anticipates the attack in advance and that it is impossible to succeed in such evasion many times on the basis of intuition alone."
  oyw.7.a:0 "What are you suggesting?"
  oyw.12.t:0 "Open war!"

  oyw.14.a:0 "Maybe we should revisit our policy."
  oyw.16.t:0 "The Changing State of the Battle in Space"
  oyw.16.d:0 "There has been a shift in the balance of power in space in response to recent changes in the situation for both sides. \n Nation Idea 'Battle in Space' is changing."
  oyw.16.a:0 "We're fighting in space too!"
  zeon.1.t:0 "Contact from the Vist Foundation."
  zeon.1.d:0 "A bald-headed man claiming to be an emissary of Cardias Vist, the current head of the Vist Foundation, contacted [ZEO.GetName] Foreign Ministry. The man, who calls himself Gael Chan, says that the Vist Foundation is in possession of a secret so important that it could undermine the existence of the [EFS.GetName] government and that he wants to send an emissary to explain it to the owner, Cardias Vist himself. It's hard to believe that one foundation holds such a secret, but given the [EFS.GetAdjective] government's history of favoring the Vist Foundation in any deal, it seems certain that it holds some promise."
  zeon.1.a:0 "We'll consider it."
  zeon.1.a_desc:0 "Building an intelligence network on [SI5.GetAdjective] to make the recovery of §Y Laplace's box §! feasible."

  zeon.2.d:0 "Zeonic's MS-05 'Zaku', completed by the mobile suit development program led by Dr. Trenov Y. Minovsky, reported near-perfect results in every test. The commander-in-chief and military leaders were very pleased with the result and decided to adopt the MS-05 as a standardized weapon. It was decided that the MS-05 will go into mass production immediately and to move forward with preparing a cover story to keep [EFS.GetAdjective] unaware."
  zeon.2.a:0 "War will change."
  zeon.3.t:0 "Total Warfare Research"
  zeon.3.d_1:0 "The Joint Chiefs of Staff, who had been conducting operational research for the opening days of the war, concluded that not only would a thorough mobilization of supplies and men be necessary to bridge the overwhelming national power gap with [EFS.GetAdjective], but that an operation would be necessary that would greatly discourage the [EFS.GetName] from fighting. While there is much condemnation of this operation, which sees an asteroid used as a giant nuclear warhead and cause a nuclear winter on Earth, the Joint Chiefs of Staff have responded that it is possible to minimize the impact on the Earth's environment by calculating the angle of entry into the atmosphere."
  zeon.3.d_2:0 "The report of the operational research that had been advanced by General Gihren's Initiative was compiled by the Pennemünde Agency. Named Operation British by the Commander-in-Chief himself, the operation is intended to counter the overwhelming power gap with the [EFS.GetAdjective] and severely discouraged the people from fighting. The execution of this operation will require not only the assignment of nearly all of the [ZEO.GetAdjective] total force, but also the mobilization of all of our knowledge and will."
  zeon.3.a:0 "Short term decisive battle!"
  zeon.4.t:0 "Reunion"
  zeon.4.d:0 "The search party reported that they had secured the missing Apsalas and its pilot in the snowy mountains. After losing control, Apsalas made an untimely landing on a snowy mountain, but despite the sub-zero conditions the pilot reportedly suffered no noticeable injuries. However, the wrecked machine was self-destructed at the hands of the pilot to preserve confidentiality."
  zeon.4.a:0 "Is the research okay?"
  zeon.5.t:0 "Approval of Gradual Autonomy."
  zeon.5.d:0 "[EFS.GetAdjective] The government's multiple rounds of negotiations with moderate lawmakers appear to be finally coming to fruition. The lawmakers said that the next [EFS.GetAdjective] General Assembly will officially recognize the current regime as a special measures law for [ZEO.GetAdjective] and promised that the day when full autonomy will be granted will not be far away."
  zeon.5.a:0 "Deikun, are you seeing this?"
  zeon.6.t:0 "Negotiations Break Down."
  zeon.6.d:0 "[EFS.GetAdjective] Despite several rounds of negotiations with moderate lawmakers in the government, [EFS.GetAdjective] lawmakers have unilaterally given notice of the end of the negotiations, saying that any further negotiations would be pointless. This has made our path to our long-cherished wish of gaining the autonomy for Spacenoids almost hopeless."
  zeon.6.a:0 "....."
  zeon.7.t:0 "Apsalus Launch Test"
  zeon.7.d:0 "[ZEO.GetAdjective] reports from Major General Ginias Sahalin, the Sergeant General of the Sakharine family, a prestigious family of [ZEO.GetAdjective], that a large flying MA Apsalas, which was in the experimental stage, is now on track for practical use. Although it is still in the flight test phase, they are on track to secure the power required for weaponization and they plan to conduct a ground-based activation test."
  zeon.7.a:0 "Let's hope so."
  zeon.8.t:0 "Mobile Cruiser Zanzibar Class in Space."
  zeon.8.d:0 "Today the first ship of the Zanzibar class, a new class of ship for our space forces, went into space in secret. As a mobile cruiser, this ship can enter the atmosphere by itself and has the ability to fly directly after entry.   It is designed to operate in an invasion of the Earth and transport weapons and supplies. It is also possible to re-enter the atmosphere by attaching a booster. As it is an extremely strategic ship, the General Staff has decided to treat this vessel as a top secret."
  zeon.8.a:0 "Who the hell tested that?"
  zeon.9.t:0 "The Truth About Blue Eyes"
  zeon.9.d:0 "After the discovery of Casval Rem Deikun, the investigation team interviewed him. As a result a startling truth was revealed. When he realized that his life was being targeted by the Kycilia Institution, he took advantage of this to take the place of his doppelganger, Char Aznable, and let him die.  He then hid in Side 3 while impersonating Char. If this were true it would be possible to say that Casval Rem Deikun was partially involved in the death of Mr. Char Aznable, if not directly."
  zeon.9.a:0 "Zeon needs a Deikun."
  zeon.9.b:0 "The public is not going to be convinced."
  zeon.10.t:0 "The Earth Federation Rejects the Deal."
  zeon.10.d:0 "The secret talks with the Prime Minister of the [EFS.GetName] government, which was conditioned on the lifting of economic sanctions and significant concessions of autonomy in exchange for the return of the Laplace Box, has broken down.  The policy of the [EFS.GetAdjective] government was that they would not recognized any municipality as a sovereign state since, and that [ZEO.GetAdjective] was no exception."
  zeon.10.a:0 "If you please."
  zeon.11.t:0 "The Asylum of Dr. Minovsky"
  zeon.11.d:0 "It is now almost certain that Dr. Trenov Y. Minovsky is plotting to defect to [EFS.GetAdjective]. It has been revealed that he has been in contact with [EFS.GetAdjective] military officials on several occasions through his agents, and that he may have handed footage of the S.U.I.T. program exercises to [EFS.GetAdjective]. Given the seriousness of the secrecy involved in [ZEO.GetAdjective] as well as Dr. Minovsky's work in physics, we can't afford to let him go into exile like this."
  zeon.11.a:0 "Block asylum."
  zeon.11.b:0 "Give them asylum."
  zeon.12.t:0 "Side [?global.op_british_side] Colony Begins Moving Toward Earth"
  zeon.12.d:0 "The installation of the nuclear pulse engines on Side [?global.op_british_side] Colony, that had been seized by a special force led by the Foreign Legion, had been completed and the colony had begun to change its orbit and move toward Earth. The impact caused by a 30-kilometer-long colony landing on Earth is thought to be equivalent to 60000 megatons and would blow Jaburo to hell."
  zeon.12.a:0 "It is an iron gesture of judgment on these fools."
  zeon.13.t:0 "Admiral Dozle Zabi and Ms. Zenna Mina are Married."
  zeon.13.d:0 "The [ZEO.GetAdjective] public is in a celebratory mood with surprise at the sudden declaration of the engagement of General Dzur Zabi, who is known as a martial faction among the Zabi family and has been largely out of touch with the public. What's more his partner, Xena Mina, is rumored to be a student at the officer's school where General Dozle is the dean and is a talented and beautiful woman."
  zeon.13.a:0 "Congrats are in order!"
  zeon.14.t:0 "A Daughter is Born to General Dozle and Lady Zenna."
  zeon.14.d:0 "A girl was safely born to Lady Zenna and General Dozle. The child was named Mineva Lao Zabi and both mother and child are reportedly in good health. To the reporters who packed the Munzo National Memorial Hospital where the the baby was delivered, Admiral Dozle looked very restless, which was a change from his usual warrior-like expression.  He pleaded that the mother and child's health should be the first priority and that they should be taken care of properly."
  zeon.14.a:0 "You've become a parent, Dozle."
  zeon.15.t:0 "The Great Serpent has Disappeared into Loum."
  zeon.15.d:0 "Prototype Fleet Decisive Artillery Jormungando Technical Test Report \n\nFor a decisive fleet battle in Loum, Jormungando fired a total of three bullets. The first strike tore the enemy Magellan class to pieces. Its power is outstanding. \nBut due to the fact that the orders for indirect fire had not yet arrived, it could not be the decisive blow at the Battle of Loum. In addition, it is regrettable for the 603 Technical Test Squadron that it lost Captain Alexandre Henme during operations. If they had the same support as the other more maneuverable weapons introduced at the same time, there is a possibility that the result would have been different. \n\nLieutenant of Technology Oliver May."
  zeon.15.a:0 "Received"
  zeon.16.t:0 "Moves Toward an End of War Agreement"
  zeon.16.d1:0 "Although the initial goal of the operation, the destruction of the Jaburo base, was not achieved, the damage to Earth from the colony drop has exceeded our expectations due to the expansion of the damage area caused by the collapse of the colony in orbit. Now that the [EFS.GetAdjective] government is barely functioning, the Earthoids' willingness to fight a long war is severely diminished. As planned, [SI6.GetAdjective] should probably strike up a conference to end the war through the government."
  zeon.16.d2:0 "While the initial goal of the operation did not result in a chilling of the Earth, the impact of the falling asteroid trigged a global tsunami and the effects of the billowing dust cuased by the impact would continue to affect the Earth's climate for many years to come. Now that the [EFS.GetAdjective] government is barely functioning, the Earthoids' willingness to fight a long war is severely diminished. As planned, [SI6.GetAdjective] should probably strike up a conference to end the war through the government."
  zeon.16.a:0 "Good."
  zeon.17.t:0 "[SI2.GetName] Federation Silences Leaked Information on Attack"
  zeon.17.d:0 "[EFS.GetAdjective] intelligence officers infiltrating the military have reported that the [SI2.GetAdjective] attack plan we circulated has been treated as misinformation with little investigation and has apparently not been communicated to the upper echelons of the military at all."
  zeon.17.a:0 "This is the proof of corruption in the Federation."
  zeon.18.t:0 "Secret meeting with Kycilia Zabi."
  zeon.18.d:0 "The daughter of the Zabi family, Kycilia Zabi (Rumored to be the head of the [ZEO.GetAdjective] Intelligence Agency), has entered the country in secret as a government ambassador-at-large. In a meeting with the mayor, she demanded that [EFS.GetAdjective] be allowed to station an equivalent force at [GRA.GetAdjective], but according to the information we have obtained in advance, it is clear that [ZEO.GetAdjective] is contemplating some kind of military operation and our fate will be in the hands of [ZEO.GetAdjective] if we accept this proposal."
  zeon.18.a:0 "Get out of my Office!"
  zeon.18.b:0 "I'm forced to accept it."
  zeon.19.t:0 "[EFS.GetAdjective] a Warning from the Government"
  zeon.19.d:0 "[EFS.GetAdjective]A senior government official met with the mayor in secret. Although the talks were cordial, they implied that the [EFS.GetAdjective] government was concerned about the relationship between us and [ZEO.GetAdjective] in the recent past. Although the senior official did not say much, it seems that the [EFS.GetAdjective] government knows more about the interaction between us and [ZEO.GetAdjective] than we can imagine."
  zeon.19.a:0 "The Relationship with [ZEO.GetAdjective] needs to be Reviewed."
  zeon.19.b:0 "I will not falter to threats."

  zeon.20.d:0 "The General Staff reported that the original goal of fortifying Solomon and A Baoa Qu to secure [GRA.GetAdjective] has been completed and the mainland defense line is finished. I think we are now well-positioned to fight [EFS.GetAdjective]."

  zeon.21.d:0 "Regarding Captain Challia Bull, a longtime Captain of the Jupiter fleet who has survived numerous fleet crises with his outstanding command skills, the Flanagan Agency summarizes the report as "a natural born Newtype". According to the report, Captain Challia Bull's superior insight and intuition are beyond the level of an ordinary person and his brain waves are extremely strong."

We will defeat all of them and complete the test mission. I believe that the results of this battle have wiped out the past rejections.

In addition to carrying spacecraft such as the Saberfish, it can also fly in colonies and in the atmosphere with the new Minovsky craft technology and can even enter and re-exit the atmosphere on its own. With this high degree of mobility, it should be able to operate as a rapid-strike landing ship that can quickly deploy ground troops to any battlefield. The first ship will be launched into space after a flight test on Earth, and then a final test on Luna II."

Long behold, the boy was the son of Dr. Tem Ray, the chief developer of the RX project.  The boy was the first to board an RX-78 and shoot down two Zakus during the battle."

The RX-78, which is the most versatile of the RX series that was being developed by the RX project, is expected to demonstrate high combat power on any battlefield.   The RX-78 has become a mobile suit that can also be said to be the apex of the technology of the [EFS.GetName] army.  The development was led by Chief Tem Ray of Anaheim Electronics who developed each part and armament in collaboration with various companies. As a result, production costs are extremely high, but several prototypes are scheduled to be produced. The company plans to develop mass-produced units based on the operational tests of these RX series as feedback."

The enemy Zakus have already been repulsed by the defense forces, but the RX series mobile suits and the Pegasus-class assault lander White Base, which are the key points of Operation V, have been damaged by this battle. \The attack also appears to have resulted in casualties not only to the colony's residents, but also to the mobile suit pilots and White Base crew.

This weapon has no apparent armament and was acting with a fighters escort, so it is thought to be a new weapon in the prototype stage.

In addition, the Ensign herself confessed that he was in love with this enemy soldier, and since he showed no sign of remorse it was clear that he would repeat the same act if he went out on the battlefield again. {\\n\n}[EFS.GetName] Major Alice Miller, Public Security Division, Intelligence Division."

On a battlefield with no dependable parents or friends, his instinct to simply survive and surpass his rivals forced him to adapt to the situation. The people who understood him best and sought to understand him best were, ironically, the strong opponents who wanted to kill him.

  efsf.51.d_2:0 "The results of the Newtype test on the crew of the White Base Squadron were reported. While there is still much that is unknown about the newtype, it has been found that it exhibits different brain wave patterns than normal people when subjected to psychological pressure.

Although there are still many unknowns about newtypes, the researchers have found that it is possible to select them by examining their specific sensing waves.

The survey also asked about the relationship between each Side and the Lunar city and not only did a majority of people say that economic sanctions against [ZEO.GetAdjective] were not enough, but there was a significant increase from the previous survey in the opinion that other Sides and Lunar cities should do more to contribute to the Earth's economy."
