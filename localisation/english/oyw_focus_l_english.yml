 zeon_harmony_with_deikun_desc:0 "Even now, more than 5 years after the unnatural death of Zeon Zum Deikun, the philosophy of Zeonism as he conceived it still resonates within the minds of Spacenoids.

The irony is that the anger is directed not only to [EFS.GetAdjective] but also to [ZEO.GetAdjective]'s current regime. Now the media discusses what Zeonism should be, without the Zabi family, and public opinion calls for an active discussion in Congress."

 zeon_revival_of_ral_family_desc:0 "The Ral family used to have a considerable influence on the Zeon faction, along with the Zabi family, but after the death of Deikun (perhaps due to the plot of the Zabi family), Jimba Ral was lost. He was found killed on Earth. His first son, Ramba Ral, was pulled out of politics and became a soldier, but now that the influence of the Zabi family has weakened, it is time to regain the honor of the house and be on the stage for Zeon's ideals."

 zeon_restructuring_of_military_desc:0 "The powerful dictatorship of the Zabi family was supported by the staff headquarters, formed from the former soldiers of the Zabi family, the guards and the intelligence agency organized by the eldest sister, Kycilia.

Now the world situation has changed completely. Zeonism, which had been made obscene by the Zabi family, is once again regaining its brilliant ideals and showing the potential of new people. Still, the Zabi family cannot be forgiven. This should put an end to that matter."

 zeon_solidarity_among_colonies_desc:0 "In the past, the [EFS.GetName] government has cleverly inhibited solidarity between the sides by clashing the interests of each side against each other and treating them unequally, but now the spacenoids of all sides are showing a willingness to stand in solidarity and unite against the [EFS.GetAdjective] government in the name of [ZEO.GetAdjective].

After the meeting is over, we'll have time for any number of secret conversations."
 zeon_moon_aliance:0 "Invest in Colony Construction"
 zeon_moon_aliance_desc:0 "From mining to processing the ore needed to build the colony, colony construction is done by the Colony Corporation on the moon. Side 7, which is now under construction, is significantly behind schedule due to the government's difficulty in securing a budget [EFS.GetName]. As we invest in building colonies, the space immigration business should be able to move forward and we can expect a big payback."

 zeon_joint_research_desc:0 "When Dr. Trenov Y. Minovsky was expelled from the Society, we supported his work resulting in the greatest scientific discovery of the Universal Century, the physics of Minovsky.

 zeon_comrades_of_deikun_desc:0 "It's been five years since Zeon Zum Deikun's aide, Degwin Sod Zabi, handed over the reigns to his son, Gihren Zabi, but doubts about Gihren's pointed hand have reached Degwin. If they continue to push forward, Gihren could destroy both Zeon and the Zabi family.

 zeon_eliminate_extremist:0 "Eliminate Radicals"
 zeon_eliminate_extremist_desc:0 "Some of the servicemen who have taken to the Gihren era have clearly been poisoned by Gihren's electoral ideas. These radical officers, who doubt the superiority of Zeon, are short-sighted people who don't know politics or the fear of the Federation, and are even in danger of losing control.

 zeon_efforts_to_avoid_war_desc:0 "Once upon a time, what Zeon Zum Deikun aimed to do was to innovate and newtype all of humanity, so to speak. Realizing the political dangers of this, the Federation acquiesced to Zeon's privileged position on the condition that the idea of Zeonism would not be exported outside of Zeon, and Zeonism was replaced by the idea of Zeon's electorate. Gihren has pushed the clock too far. Now that we have no chance of winning, we must continue our efforts to avoid war."

 zeon_tyrant_of_moon_desc:0 "There is one more force in the earthosphere besides [EFS.GetAdjective] and the sides. They are called "Lunarians" who live in the Free City on the Moon. They have different values and political power than either the Spacenoids living in our colonies or the Earthoids living on Earth.

 zeon_concession_to_efsf_desc:0 "The trajectory correction to maintain peace in the Earth sphere is almost a success. [ZEO.GetAdjective]The public is not as radical as it used to be, and there is even an argument that we should look for ways to coexist with other sides and even [EFS.GetName].

 zeon_declaration_of_war_is_hatred_deeply_desc:0 "Negotiations with [EFS.GetAdjective] for the avoidance of war have been utterly betrayed and efforts have been trampled. I have made the same mistake I once made when I was bitterly hoping to gain independence by negotiating with the Federation that Comrade Zeon Zum Deikun had aspired to. [ZEO.GetAdjective] was twice betrayed by [EFS.GetAdjective]. This anger is not at [EFS.GetAdjective], but at myself. This hatred is the hatred of Deikun and himself."

The younger sons, Dozle and Garma, have also been unable to come to terms with their military ideas, and now the National Army has become a factional battleground between Gihren, Kycilia, and Dozle.

 zeon_repression_of_deikun_desc:0 "More than 5 years after Zeon Zum Deikun's untimely death, his influence as a thinker and politician still persists in [ZEO.GetAdjective]. It is also true that although they have eliminated the politicians and influential members of the Deikun faction, including the Ral family of Jimba Ral, after Deikun's death, there are still unpatriotic people who do not approve of the ways of the Zabi family.

Many failures of MS on Earth are due to the environments in which they operate meaning they have to traverse extremely harsh terrain leading to wear on the legs of MS. In order to solve this problem, a strategy has been devised by the Earth forces to make the Dodai, originally developed as a bomber, carry an MS allowing it to act as a makeshift air transport"

This boom has recently spread to the middle class and has the potential to become a viable export commodity for the planet.

However, several recent sighting reports support that [ZEO.GetAdjective] is seriously researching this weapon. Although skeptics still prevail within the [EFS.GetAdjective] military, we are certainly behind [ZEO.GetAdjective] in this area and we too will need to promote basic research on giant humanoid weapons."

Minovsky, has already been used militarily in the form of mega-particle cannons and thermonuclear reactors, but its property of attenuating all radio waves and causing electronic devices to malfunction has been dismissed as inadequate for military use beyond being able to protect its own armament, and [ZEO.GetAdjective] is receiving information that new tactics to exploit this property are being seriously studied. We should be doing more research."

 efsf_plan_rx_desc:0 "We're behind [ZEO.GetAdjective] in mobile suit development. Although military leaders are still skeptical about the military usefulness of the MS, they have decided that it is on the [EFS.GetAdjective's] honor to continue to be beaten by the [ZEO.GetAdjective] in this area, and have decided to promote comprehensive research on this new weapon, including basic research and development of mobile suits, countermeasures, and methods of operation."

 efsf_plan_v:0 "Operation V"
 efsf_plan_v_desc:0 "The reason why we were defeated in the initial battle against [ZEO.GetAdjective] despite the overwhelming difference in strength was that our [EFS.GetAdjective] fleet was completely unable to respond to tactics that centered on disabling electronic devices with Minovsky particles and visual combat that utilized the mobility of the mobile suits. Although Jaburo's General Staff, which does not know the field does not approve, any further defeats may mean that the front will not be able to be sustained, and now there is not a moment to lose, and we must vigorously promote this operation for the purpose of MS development, operation, and tactical research."

 efsf_focus_on_beam_equipment_desc:0 "The mega-particle artillery weapons that MS can carry will give our troops a significant advantage in anti-MS combat because their bullet speed is nearly the speed of light, making them difficult to evade and their steady attack power is not affected by pilot proficiency."
 efsf_focus_on_amu_equipment:0 "Focus on Kinetic Weapons"
 efsf_focus_on_amu_equipment_desc:0 "Although beam weapons are extremely powerful, their production costs are high, and there are many challenges in the field, such as the small number of shots that can be charged and difficult maintenance.

Our defeat in the early stages of the war against [ZEO.GetName] stems from a complete lack of understanding of these two new technologies. We should establish a new combat doctrine, even if it means abandoning all other previous combat doctrines."
