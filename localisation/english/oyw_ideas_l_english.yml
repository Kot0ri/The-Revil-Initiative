The ambitious Degwin was not only attracted to Deikun's ideas, but also to the use of his charisma and his own political power, and from then on they were to share a political struggle. He had five children, all of whom were half-siblings. He is said to have been the mastermind behind the assassination of Zeon Zum Daekun, but the truth remains unresolved. After Deikun's death, he took over as his successor and established a dictatorship, but as he grew older, he lost his passion for Zeon's independence and handed over the reigns to his son, Giren. Even after giving up the viceroyalty, he still held a certain amount of power as Duke King, but he was reluctant to go to war and repeatedly confirmed the odds against Giren. Towards the end of the war, he arbitrarily sought peace with the Federation in a meeting with the Commander-in-Chief of the Federation Army, Reville, but was irradiated by Gillen, who perceived it, and he disappeared along with his flagship, Glade Degwin."

Kycilia was implicitly asked to watch over Gihren  by her father, Degwin, who wanted to stop Gihren  from running amok, and because of this, she built her own information network. The Mobile Strike Force Intelligence Department, colloquially known as the Kycilia Agency, not only carried out espionage using local civilians, but also carried out sabotage and rearranging operations with MS units such as the Cyclops Corps and Wolf Gar, which operated under their own chain of command. Ma Kube, who was also an aide to her, is said to have delivered some of the ore from the Odessa mine directly to Kycilia instead of sending it to her home country. He was also one of the first to recognize the usefulness of the Newtype, and established the Flanagan Agency for the research and deployment of the Newtype in combat.

Nevertheless, Degwin Sod Zabi and Darcia seem to have cooperated in the management of the state, but when his son, Gihren Zabi, came to power, he was largely left outside the mosquito net. The realist Dalusia inherited the line of cooperation with other sides promoted by Zeon Zum Daekun, but did not believe in human innovation, thinking of it as an expedient to control the country and negotiate with the Federation. Although he had a strong sense of urgency about Gillen's policies, he acted as a coordinator with the parliament to realize the wishes of the Zabi family in order to protect himself and avoid political confusion. After the war, he remained as prime minister and worked hard to deal with the war, while ostensibly denying the Zeon remnants.

He deserves praise for the burden he took on and the results he achieved by planning an operation without any know-how of a ship operating a mobile suit, without any decent instructions from the military, and with a significant lack of regular crew members, and by trying to plan the operation of the mobile suit and pilot in real combat. It may have been a blessing in disguise that he was still a cadet and hadn't been steeped in the big ship cannonism of the Federation Army. He operated his ships and mobile suits with flexible ideas such as actively incorporating the opinions of subordinates and pilots to formulate operations. The operational data of the Pegasus class that he showed in actual battle was the core of Operation V, and the decision to increase production of the Pegasus class was made because of its greater-than-expected results, and it had a profound impact on the post-war Federation doctrine, but he himself remained a captain in the field without a career path."

Matilda also made contact with Amuro Ray and Sayla Mass, and it seems that Revil had some interest in their abilities and births.

With the majority of the crew being civilians and inexperienced young men, it's not hard to imagine the extraordinary pressure of captaining the White Base. Because of his own young age, he was always worried about how he should behave as a captain. At first he was hysterical about the selfish behavior of Amuro Rei and the other civilians, but as he gained experience in combat, he began to see a talent in Amuro, Sayla, and Mirai that he didn't have, and he became a leader enough to be able to rely on their Newtype-like abilities to judge him. After being formally reorganized in Jaburo as the 13th Independent Unit, he went into space again and commanded the diversionary operations before Operation Chamberlain, and in addition, he was in the front line as an assault force on A Bao'a Ku in Operation Star One. In the Battle of A Baoa Qu, White Base finally destroyed his engine and ran aground, but many of his crew members managed to escape and he himself survived the One Year War.

Eventually, as he is exposed to the deaths of his comrades and the attitudes of the soldiers who bravely carry out their missions, he comes to realize the meaning of fighting and the role he must play. By the time he finished his mission on Earth and went back into space, he was one of the ace pilots in the Federation Army. There is no doubt that the battle in space prompted the awakening of the Newtype, and the accurate and unparalleled shooting that predicted the enemy's movements resulted in the annihilation of 12 Rick Doms in 3 minutes in Side 6, and from this time on, the control of the mobile suit became more and more awesome, and was feared by the soldiers of the Zeon army, called the White Devil. His encounter and breakup with the Zeon army's new type, Laraa Sun, was a trauma that would never be erased for him, as well as a lifelong affair with his rival, Char Aznable.

After the end of the One Year War, the Union Army hired a large number of young men to make up for the loss of manpower, and to those soldiers who were unaware of the war, the Union Army was only perceived as a safe, stable, and female-popular occupation. For better or worse, he's an iconic figure for the Union soldiers of his time."
 albion_sf_3:0 "South Burning"
 albion_sf_3_desc:0 "Captain of the 4th Platoon of Immortals and Mobile Suit Instructor for Torrington Base. He felt that he was past his peak as a pilot and was focused on developing young pilots like Ko Uraki and Chuck Keith. Not only his subordinates, but also his captain, Aper Synapse, had full confidence in the precise judgment and operational command that came from that experience."
 albion_sf_4:0 "Bernard Monsha"
 albion_sf_4_desc:0 "During the One Year War, he was in the 4th Platoon of Immortals. He has a crush on Nina Purpleton, a dispatch from Anaheim Electronics, and persistently asks her out, but she keeps him on his sleeve. On the one hand, he is a self-centered person who doesn't take his surroundings into consideration when it comes to his own goals, such as making an attempt to challenge the pilot of Gundam Prototype 1 to a match against Ko Uraki, who is also attracted to Nina. On the other hand, he also shows a compassionate side, such as respecting South Banning deeply and weeping when he is killed in battle.
 albion_sf_5:0 "Alpha A. Bait"
 albion_sf_5_desc:0 "During the One Year War, I was in the 4th Platoon of Immortals. During the Derrards conflict, after the death of South Bunning, he became a war captain and a captain of the MS Corps."
 albion_sf_6:0 "Chap Adel"
 albion_sf_6_desc:0 "During the One Year War, I was in the 4th Platoon of Immortals. Unlike Moncia and Bate, he didn't take his own abilities on the nose, and even though he was the youngest, he could be seen admonishing his two seniors."
 tech603_sf_1:0 "Martin Prochnow"
 tech603_sf_1_desc:0 "Former captain of the liaison freighter Jotunheim. He was then drafted into the Principality of Zeon and entered military service with other crews as captain of the 603 Technical Test Squadron. Captain Monique Cadillac, on secondment from the Pennemünde Agency, told him that he was akin to his mother's Yorkshire terrier. Watching these soldiers risk their lives to do what they can while carrying out their missions as military personnel, they did not even bother to risk their ships in the mission to refurbish the Zeon forces that had been launched to escape Earth, and made a desperate rescue attempt."
 tech603_sf_2:0 "Ehrlich Kruger"
 tech603_sf_2_desc:0 "Jotunheim's XO. He has known Captain Prochnow for more than ten years, since Jotunheim was a liaison freighter, and he has earned the immense trust of his captain. He is a quiet character in a noisy Jotunheim, but he properly understands the captain's thoughts and communicates them to his crew."

 tech603_sf_3_desc:0 "Navigators of Jotunheim. It was not only steering, but also communications and information analysis. His accurate judgment of the situation earned him the trust of his captain."
 tech603_sf_4:0 "Hideto Washiya"
 tech603_sf_4_desc:0 "Mobile suit pilot in the 603 technical test squad. In Jotunheim, where differences of position and purpose persist, his unlikable character and openness have always been a mood-maker on the ship. During the Zegog test, he and his passenger, Werner Holbein, screamed during a descent into the atmosphere and were said to have become two idiots, giving the impression that he was a good-natured man. However, he was a warm-hearted man who shed tears of sympathy for his colleague who died of engine trouble during the EMS-10 Zuda test.
 tech603_sf_5:0 "Aleksandro Hemme"
 tech603_sf_5_desc:0 "A tapped-out military man who had served in the artillery department since before the One Year War. He calls himself a self-proclaimed artilleryman and is confident in his artillery skills, but he is unhappy that he was assigned to the technical test ship Jotunheim as soon as the war broke out, as the time has shifted to mobile suit warfare. In the Battle of Ruum, the prototype fleet decisive gun Jormungando was entrusted to the 603 Technical Test Squadron and sank a single Magellan class ship in a single blow, but was killed in action shortly afterwards."
 tech603_sf_6:0 "Erwin Cadillac"
 tech603_sf_6_desc:0 "A school mobilized soldier replenished by the Kaspen Combat Battalion. At the end of the war, he was assigned to Jotunheim as a pilot of the Oggo, a mobile pod developed by Zeon. Despite his first sortie, he showed excellent qualities by decimating the Federation's ball force and persuading the remaining one to be taken prisoner, but he was killed in action when he was shot with a ball of prisoners by the Salamis class. Monique Cadillac is my sister."

 kiki_rosita_desc:0 "The only daughter of a family that played a village role in a small settlement in Southeast Asia. The settlement was located deep in the jungle, cut off from civilization, and lived an almost self-sufficient life. Southeast Asia was a fierce war zone where the power chart between the Federation and Zeon was frequently changed, so the ruling forces were constantly changing, and every time she saw the situation she was forced to cooperate with both armies in various ways. A meeting with Shiloh Amada, a military man who is single-mindedly trying to keep his word, makes her believe in people again, and she gradually becomes interested in Shiloh. Eventually, she realized that the thought was a faint crush, but she knew more than anyone else that it was an unfulfilled love."

They call General Gihren Zabi's ideas "selective thinking" and turn their attention away from reality in favor of only practicing Zeonism for all spacenoids. Any criticism of the government that goes too far will need to be cracked down on."
